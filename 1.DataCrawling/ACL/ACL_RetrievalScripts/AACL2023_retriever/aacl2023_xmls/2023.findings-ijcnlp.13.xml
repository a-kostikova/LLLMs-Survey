<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper introduces the problem of determining whether people are located in the locations they mention in their Twitter streams. In particular, we investigate the role of context-tweets published before and after a tweet mentioning a location-in this challenging problem. We present a new corpus of Twitter streams with spatial information. Our analyses show that context is key to define the ground truth, as human judgments depend on whether annotators have access to context. Experimental results show that a neural architecture that takes into account context in addition to the tweet mentioning a location yields better results. We also conduct an error analysis to provide insights into the errors made by our best model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Information extraction has been popular since decades ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cardie, 1997)</ref>. One of its subareas is geotagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheng et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mahmud et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jurgens et al., 2021)</ref>, which aims at adding geographical information to an entity. A common example of geotagging is to predict the home location of Twitter users <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Elmongui et al., 2015)</ref>. Geotagging users with their home location is challenging because people change their location often thus they may not tweet from their home location.</p><p>Twitter is a social network in which users post short messages known as tweets. Business reports state that the number of daily active users went from 166 million in April 2021 to 229 million in April 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kemp, 2022)</ref>. According to a recent report <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dean, 2021)</ref>, (a) the Twitter app was downloaded over 6 million times in the fourth quarter of 2020, and (b) Twitter users in the US spend on average 158.2 minutes per month on the app. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beveridge (2021)</ref> reports that more than 500 million tweets are published per day.</p><p>Users rarely geotag their tweets with their GPS coordinates. Previous studies estimate that only t before t 0 t after Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Tweet mentioning Miami (t 0 ) and the tweets published before and after (t before and t after ). t 0 by itself is insufficient to determine whether the author was in Miami: (a) based on the text, the author could be tweeting about Miami from anywhere, and (b) the picture of the sky could be from almost anywhere. Considering context-the tweets published before and afterprovides enough evidence to conclude that the author was in Miami when he published t 0 as he was there on vacation and eventually had to go back to work. 0.85% of tweets are geotagged <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Sloan et al., 2013)</ref>. Alternatively, tweets mentioning a city can still be rich in spatial information. Mentioning a city, however, does not guarantee that the author was in the city when he tweeted-people often tweet about a city from elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Han et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the problem of determining whether people are located in the cities they mention in their tweets. More specifically, we explore the role of context-tweets published before and after the tweet that mentions a city-in this challenging problem. Consider the three tweets in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which were published in chronological order from top to bottom. Taking into account only the tweet mentioning Miami (t 0 ), it is unsound to conclude that the author was there when he published this tweet. Indeed, the text only states that Miami has the best beach, and the picture of the sky could be from almost anywhere. The tweets pub-lished before and after, however, provide enough context to conclude that the author was on vacation in Miami (sat in the beach, have to go back to work, etc.) thus he was in Miami when he tweeted t 0 . Note that t 0 is the only tweet mentioning Miami yet taking into account context is necessary to correctly determine whether the author was there.</p><p>While the work presented here could be considered fundamental research, it opens the door to several applications. For example, emergency management systems could issue customized alerts to individuals who were, are, or are about to be located near a natural disaster. Similarly, location information can be utilized to facilitate transportation planning to provide positive long-term and sustainable economic impacts on many regions.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are:<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (a) a corpus of 3,494 tweets mentioning a city (t 0 ), their context (3 tweets before and 3 tweets after), and annotations indicating whether the author was in the city when he published t 0 ; (b) analysis showing that the problem requires taking into account context-annotations change depending on whether crowdworkers have access to the context; (c) experimental results showing that taking into account tweets published both before and after the tweet mentioning the city is beneficial; and (d) qualitative analysis providing insights into the errors made by our best model, including characteristics of both t 0 and the tweets in the context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Previous works within information extraction have targeted either spatial or temporal information. Works targeting spatial information extraction include event localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pustejovsky, 2013)</ref>, and geolocation prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mousset et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chong and Lim, 2017)</ref>. Works targeting temporal information extraction include event ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Naik et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cassidy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ning et al., 2020)</ref> and event understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ma et al., 2021)</ref>. In some tasks, such as human interaction prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ke et al., 2016)</ref> and facial expression recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>, spatial and temporal information are complementary to each other. In these works, spatial/temporal information is used as contextual information.</p><p>Various kinds of context have been proved useful in many tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Yu et al. (2022)</ref> investigate the role of conversational context in annotation and detections of hate speech and counter-hate speech. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wang et al. (2015)</ref> use topic, history, and conversation information as context to detect sarcasm in Twitter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ren et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vanzo et al. (2014)</ref> use similar context to approach the task of sentiment classification. Similar to their works, we also use history tweets as the context. Therefore, the temporal information contained in history tweets is used as the context to extract spatial information.</p><p>Most previous works targeting spatial information extraction are centered around events <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mousset et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chong and Lim, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Frisoni et al., 2021)</ref>. Unlike us, these efforts do not aim at determining spatial information about people. As we shall see, people often mention places despite they are not located there. In addition, knowing the location where an event occurs does not necessarily indicate the location of the participants in the event or people talking about the event. For example, one can state that there is a housing market bubble somewhere without ever stepping foot there. Finally, we note that people change their location often and most events are much shorter than a human lifespan.</p><p>More related to our work, Fuchs et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) analyze personal behavioral patterns using geotagged tweets from the Seattle, Washington area (i.e., tweets published with geographical coordinates within Seattle). Since only 0.85% of tweets are geotagged <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Sloan et al., 2013)</ref>, their work may suffer from lack of generality. We work with tweets mentioning cities across the United States without requiring a geotag. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Doudagiri et al. (2018)</ref> annotate whether people are located at the locations they tweet about. Their corpus is not publicly available at the time of writing, and experimental results are not presented. The paper presented here is complementary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xiao and Blanco (2022)</ref> work on a task similar to ours, though they investigate the role of modality in the annotation and learning method of spatial information extraction. Differently, we show that context-tweets published before and after-must be taken into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A Corpus of Tweets and Spatial Knowledge</head><p>Our main goal is to investigate whether contextual information is beneficial to infer spatial information between authors of tweets and the locations they mention in their tweets. To our knowledge, we are the first to tackle this problem, so we create a new corpus. Doing so allows us to analyze whether human judgments depend on whether they have access to the context (i.e., tweets published before and after the tweet mentioning a location).</p><p>Collecting Tweets While one could start with a new collection of tweets, we choose to build upon an existing corpus with spatial annotations disregarding context <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Xiao and Blanco, 2022)</ref>. This corpus contains 6,540 English tweets mentioning a city and crowdsourced annotations indicating whether the author was in the city when he tweeted based on the content of the tweet and nothing else. Building upon this corpus allows us to (a) leverage their context-unaware annotations and (b) focus on our main goal: to investigate the role of context. We refer to the tweets in the existing corpus as target tweets. We complement target tweets with the three tweets published immediately before and after within a window of 90 days<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . We refer to these tweets as earlier tweets and later tweets respectively. We also refer to both earlier tweets and later tweets as context tweets. An instance thus contains seven tweets: one target tweet mentioning a city, three earlier tweets, and three later tweets (we discarded target tweets without enough context). Annotation Guidelines We aim at capturing spatial information intuitively understood by humans. To this end, we crowdsource annotations from nonexperts asking two questions. The first question is "Was the author of the tweet located in city when the target tweet was published?". Crowdworkers choose between two options:</p><p>• yes: the author of the tweets was located in city when the target tweet was published; or • no: I cannot tell whether the author of the tweets was located in city when the target tweet was published. Note that no does not guarantee that the author was not in city. It rather indicates that the crowdworkers cannot establish that the author was in city. The results of our pilot annotation show that annotators cannot determine whether the author of the tweet was in city in more than 95% of the instances that are not labeled as yes.</p><p>The second question is "How confident are you about your answer to the first question?" Crowdworkers choose options from a modified Likert scale with five options: Extremely confident, Very confident, Moderately confident, Slightly confident, and Not confident at all. The second question complements the first question and allows annotators to bridge the semantic gap between yes and no answers to the first question. During pilot annotations designed to refine the annotation guidelines, we discovered that asking these two questions results in more reliable annotations than, for example, including probably yes and probably no as options for the first question and skipping the second question. Annotation Interface and Process We crowdsource annotations on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Crowdworkers answer the questions above for one instance (the target tweet mentioning a city, three earlier tweets, and three later tweets) before moving to the next instance. In order to ensure crowdworkers read the tweets in the order they were published, the interface displays the earlier tweets, the target tweet, and the later tweets with short delays in between after workers click on the appropriate button. We display screenshots of tweets from the Twitter's website to ensure that all characters, symbols, emojis, and images are correctly displayed.</p><p>A total of 329 annotators participated in our annotation task. The hourly pay for crowd workers ranged from $9 to $13 (the federal minimum wage is $7.25). After collecting multiple annotations for each instance (Section 3.1), we replace yes labels with no if the confidence level is lower than or equal to Moderately confident. Our rationale is that yes with low confidence level indicates that there is not enough evidence about the author being located in city when the target tweet was published, which is actually the definition of no.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Annotation Quality</head><p>Ensuring annotation quality is critical in any crowdsourcing effort. Our first defense is to recruit crowdworkers located in the United States with an approval rate above 95%. Second, we do not allow workers to continue to work on our task if the average completing time per Human Intelligence Task in the past (i.e., the average time spent before submitting answers to both questions per instance) is under 8 seconds. We decided on 8 seconds based on observations during pilot annotations-one just cannot read seven tweets and answer two questions in eight seconds. In addition, we split all instances into batches of 500 instances and publish one batch every 8 hours to avoid annotator fatigue.</p><p>Our last defense is to collect five annotations per instance and filter out unreliable annotations until we obtain substantial inter-annotator agreement for each batch. We do so using Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hovy et al., 2013</ref>, MACE) and Krippendorff's α <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Krippendorff, 2011)</ref>. MACE ranks annotators by their competence scores and adjudicates labels according to these scores. Krippendorff's α is used to measure inter-annotator agreement. α = 0 indicates only the agreement expected by chance, while α = 1 indicates annotators always agree. Krippendorff's α coefficients at or above 0.6 are considered substantial and above 0.8 (almost) perfect <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>We repeat these steps for each batch until α ≥ 0.6: 1. Use MACE to calculate competence scores for workers and sort them in descending order. 2. Discard all the annotations by the crowdworker with the lowest score. 3. Calculate the Krippendorff's α coefficient on the remaining annotations. We discard instances left without annotations after the above steps. The final corpus consists of 3,494 annotated instances with Krippendorff's α = 0.76. In the rest of this paper, we work with these instances. We reserve for future work a thorough analysis of the instances with the most disagreements between annotators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Ethical considerations</head><p>Determining where people are located has the potential to open the door to malicious (or unwanted) tracking and surveillance. For example, applications that track location data may turn around and sell that data, revealing someone's every movement-whether it is to a retail store or potential malicious users such as stalkers. Equally important, Twitter users may not be aware that their tweets can be used for research purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fiesler and Proferes, 2018)</ref>. We are not interested in tracking people or surveillance. Instead, we are interested in investigating the very definition of the problem and analyzing whether and how context complements target tweets. In order to alleviate the issues above, we implemented the following safeguards:</p><p>• Our corpus only contains seven tweets per user published within 90 days thus tracking and surveillance are not enabled by this work. Neither user information nor any metadata is included in the public corpus. account the text and image in a tweet. We do not consider user information or any metadata. • We have designed a takedown request process following <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mirowski et al. (2019)</ref>. People can request us to delete tweets via an online form.</p><p>We will propagate takedown requests to researchers who download the corpus and the license will require them to delete them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Corpus Analysis</head><p>The 3,494 instances in our corpus mention 94 unique cities. The most common cities are Miami (17% of target tweets) and Chicago (6%); other cities account for at most 5% each. The annotation process results in the following label distribution: Most instances are annotated yes (67.7%), and around one-third are annotated no (32.3%). Do labels depend on whether context is available to crowdworkers? Yes, crowdworkers understand substantially different spatial information depending on whether they have access to context. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> compares our annotations and the original annotations that do not consider context. Note that the correct ground truth labels are the ones obtained taking into account context. Most target tweets annotated no without considering context are annotated yes considering context (60.7%). The percentage of annotation changes for target tweets annotated yes without context is smaller but substantial (25.5%). In other words, figuring out whether the author of a tweet is in the city he tweets about requires looking at context.</p><p>We show examples of annotation changes in Figure 2. In the first example, annotators understood that the target tweet is a news report about Philadelphia. As a result, annotators could not determine whether the author was located in Philadelphia when the target tweet was published. The later tweet, however, implicitly mentions that the author  Note that the correct ground truth is the label obtained when annotators have access to context. We only show selected tweets in the context because of space constraints (recall that we show annotators the three tweets published before and after a target tweet). Annotators understood that the target tweet in the first example was probably a news update and did not conclude that the author was in Philadelphia when they did not have access to context. The tweet published after, however, implicitly states that the author lives in that city (his bedroom is in Philly) thus the correct label is yes. The target tweet in the second example is about a local election campaign and annotators understood that the author was in Reno looking only at the target tweet. Tweets published before and after within an hour, however, mention distant locations and annotators rightfully concluded that the author was not in Reno.</p><p>lives in South Philly-his bedroom is there. Since the target and later tweets were published in consecutive days, annotators concluded that the author was in Philadelphia. In this example, context provides evidence that the target tweet is not just a news report about Philadelphia, but a report from someone who lives there.</p><p>In the second example, the target tweet shares information about a campaign event to take place in Reno, where the author lives (right on my neighborhood). Without context, annotators understood that the author was there when he published the target tweet despite the only information available was that he lives there. Looking at earlier and later tweets, however, annotators concluded that he was not in Reno as he tweeted from San Gabriel near Los Angeles shortly after.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>We use the 3,494 instances in our corpus to conduct experiments to automatically determine whether authors of tweets are located in the cities they mention in their tweets. Each instance consists of seven tweets published in chronological order. We reduce the problem to a classification task. The inputs to the model are seven tweets. The output is a label indicating whether the author of the tweets was located in the city when the target tweet was published (yes or no). We create stratified training and test splits (80% / 20%) and reserve 20% of the training split for validation. Our models do not take into account user information. They make predictions solely based on the tweets' text. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> We use Pytorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Paszke et al., 2019)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2020</head><p>). We train all the neural networks for up to 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014), categorical cross entropy as the loss function, and batch size 8. We stop the training process before 100 epochs if there is no improvement in the validation set for 10 epochs.</p><p>Context-Unaware Neural Baseline First, we experiment with a neural network that only takes into account the target tweet (t 0 ) to establish a neural baseline. The inputs of the context-unaware neural network include the tweet text and social media features we extract from the tweet text. The social media features characterize the text in a tweet and include the number of hashtags and features targeting emojis and subjective language. The supplementary materials detail all the features we work with. We use the vector associated with the CLS token returned by BERT<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> as the text representations. We concatenate the text representations and social media features and apply two trainable fully connected layers (sizes: 512 and 2) to make the final prediction (yes or no). We use dropout <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Srivastava et al., 2014)</ref> in the second-tolast fully connected layer (rate: 0.2).</p><p>Context-Aware Neural Network Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the architecture of our context-aware network. The inputs of context-aware networks are the same as the context-unaware network, except that the context-unaware network only uses one tweet (target tweet), while the context-aware networks use seven tweets (three earlier tweets, one target tweet, and three later tweets). Since BERT 5 is pretrained using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction-two general tasks not related to extracting spatiotemporal knowledge from social media posts-we extract social media features to enhance the BERT representations. We provide the details about social media features in the supplementary materials. The social media features are concatenated with the BERT representations. Note that BERT tokenizer can preprocess the inputs, thus we do not have a data preprocessing step. We use a BiLSTM (size: 1024) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> to encode the sequence of tweets (earlier, target and later tweets). We use a mean pooling layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lin et al., 2014)</ref> to downsample the feature map and keep the most informative features. We use two fully-connected layers to reduce the dimensionality. The numbers of units in the two fully connected layers are set to 512 and 2, respectively. We use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) 6  and ReLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nair and Hinton, 2010)</ref> in the secondto-last fully connected layer to avoid overfitting and vanishing gradient problems. We experimented with alternative pretrained text encoders and various configurations, including different sizes for the BiLSTM and fully connected layers. Specifically, we have explored BERTweet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nguyen et al., 2020)</ref> and max pooling. However, we do not observe any improvements from these alternative choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the experimental results with the test split using the majority baseline (always yes), the context-unaware neural network, and the contextaware networks. The context-unaware network does not outperform the majority baseline. This indicates that the context tweets are essential for the neural network to extract spatial information. We present results with the context-aware network using four inputs to represent an instance: (a) earlier tweets and target tweet, (b) target tweet and later tweets, (c) earlier tweets, target tweet and later tweets (full input), and (d) same as (c) but excluding the social media features. We note several interesting observations:</p><p>• Neither earlier nor later tweets are beneficial by themselves. Only considering either yields the same results than the majority baseline and the context-unaware network. • The social media features characterizing the text in the tweet are beneficial (F1: 0.61 vs. 0.63). In other words, these features provide information that is not captured in the distributed representation generated by BERT. Note that social media features are beneficial only when combining earlier and later tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Qualitative Analysis</head><p>To better understand what kind of mistakes our bestperforming model makes, we perform a qualitative analysis. We randomly picked 100 errors made by the best-performing model. In order to analyze the source of the errors, we divide the errors into two parts. The first part (46% of all errors) contains the errors that occur when the context tweets mislead the model. We refer to these errors as context errors.</p><p>The second part (54% of all errors) contains the errors that occur when the target tweets mislead the model. We refer to these errors as target errors.</p><p>When and why did context tweets mislead the model? Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the two most common errors in the context errors. We only show one earlier and one later tweet due to space constraints. Note that the percentages are relative to the number of context errors. The most common error (63%) occurs when there are multiple references to people and named entities in the context and target tweets. The first example (top) exemplifies this error. The tweets refer to, among others, Tom Hanks, his family, Black college student, and Peter Liang.</p><p>We hypothesize that the model struggles to identify which reference to people, if any, is semantically close to the author. The second most common error (21%) occurs when the publication timestamps is key to make the right prediction. The tweets in the second example (bottom) were published within 5 hours and mention Denver, San Diego, and Bahamas. Taking as a whole, it is not possible to tell whether the author was in any of those locations. The model, however, struggles to figure this out as it does not have access to publication timestamps.</p><p>When and why did target tweets mislead the model? Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the most common errors in the target errors. Note that the percentages are relative to the number of target errors. We only show the most common errors and the target tweets due to space constraints. The most frequent error (48%) occurs when the target tweet is a news report.</p><p>In the example (left), the author is reporting on a news event taking place in Arlington and the model wrongly predicts yes despite there is no evidence that the author was there. The second most common errors (42%) occurs when the target tweet is  an advertisement and the model predicts yes despite there is no evidence that the author was in the city at hand, as the example on the right shows. A less common source of errors (10%) occurs when the city mentioned in the target tweet is not a location. For example, Houston is sometimes used to refer to the singer rather than the city.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Context does matter in determining the relationship between the authors of tweets and the places they mention in their tweets. We have demonstrated so by (a) analyzing whether human judgments change depending on whether we show them context tweets and (b) investigating whether neural networks benefit from incorporating context tweets. We found that 36.9% of human judgments change depending on whether we show context tweets. Experimental results demonstrate that networks that incorporate context tweets yield better results.</p><p>We have created a corpus of 3,494 instances which consists of seven tweets (three eariler tweets, one target tweet, and three later tweets) published in chronological order. The annotations include whether the authors of tweets are in the locations they mention in a target tweet. As part of our future work, we plan to experiment with longer contexts and include tweet timestamps. Also, we plan to address the most common cause of errors: multiple mentions to people and named entities. Our research agenda includes investigating how to differentiate between entities mentioned in a tweet and those who participate in the events described in a tweet (including the author), or more generally, described in social media data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Limitations</head><p>The work presented here has several limitations:</p><p>Corpus and annotations. First, our corpus only contains tweets written in English and containing a city in the US. While accounting for any location worldwide is outside the scope of the paper, it is possible that the corpus does not generalize to other locales. Second, in order to ensure high agreements, we disregarded annotations of the worseperforming crowdworkers (final corpus size: 3,494 instances). This strategy has the potential to also disregard the most challenging instances (i.e., most ambiguous in the eyes of the annotators) and may simplify the problem of extracting saptial knowledge in general.</p><p>Experiments and results. Our models rely on large pre-trained transformer that are not available in all languages and require substantial computation. We note, however, that the social media features we define manually do not have this issue and bring substantial improvements. Additional limitations of the current models are described in the Qualitative Analysis (Section 5.2).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>in Philadelphia when t0 was published?

We only show selected tweets in the context because of space constraints (recall that we show annotators the three tweets published before and after a target tweet). Annotators understood that the target tweet in the first example was probably a news update and did not conclude that the author was in Philadelphia when they did not have access to context. The tweet published after, however, implicitly states that the author lives in that city (his bedroom is in Philly) thus the correct label is yes. The target tweet in the second example is about a local election campaign and annotators understood that the author was in Reno looking only at the target tweet. Tweets published before and after within an hour, however, mention distant locations and annotators rightfully concluded that the author was not in Reno.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,103.88,236.98,111.60,100.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The most common error (63%) occurs when there are many named entities in the tweets, especially persons. The first example (top) illustrates this error type. The many mentions of people (Tom Hanks, his family, Black college students, and Peter Liang) mislead the model. The second most common error (21%) occurs because the model does not have access to tweet timestamps. The second example (bottom) exemplifies this scenario. It is unlikely that somebody is in Denver, San Diego and Bahamas within 5 hours, and the model wrongly predicted that the author was in San Diego when he published the target tweet despite earlier and later tweets indicate otherwise.</figDesc><graphic coords="8,370.79,267.04,122.40,80.02" type="bitmap" /></figure>
