<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Persuasive meme identification is a crucial task in automatically categorizing memes based on their persuasive nature. Memes, being highly influential in online communication, have the ability to shape individuals' attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs, both positively and negatively. They can be utilized to promote positive actions, challenge social norms, and raise awareness, but they can also perpetuate harmful ideologies, spread misinformation, stereotype, and manipulate emotions. In this paper, we are addressing this challenge by empirically investigating three novel tasks, viz. (i) Task 1: Persuasive meme detection, (ii) Task 2: Identification of the effectiveness of persuasive memes, and (iii) Task 3: Identification of persuasion techniques used in persuasive memes. To this end, we make the very first attempt to release a highquality, large-scale dataset, Persuasive_meme 1 , since there is no publicly available such dataset for the Hindi-English code-mixed (Hinglish) domain. 2 We further developed several baseline unimodal and multimodal models for these tasks. Empirical evaluation with respect to both, qualitative and quantitative analysis, on the Persuasive_meme dataset highlight the significance of multimodality in addressing these tasks effectively. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of the current models and emphasize the need for further research to overcome these challenges.</p></div>

These memes possess the potential for both positive and negative impacts, captivating audiences and shaping their perceptions.

Meme analysis is, therefore, essential for detecting offensive content, analyzing psychological responses, and gaining a deeper understanding of the persuasive strategies employed in online communication, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rijhwani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sharma et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kiela et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Suryawanshi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hossain et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sharma et al., 2022)</ref>. Prior studies have primarily focused on the humorous and cultural aspects of memes, overlooking their potential as persuasive tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Seiffert-Brockmann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nee and Maio, 2019)</ref>. Consequently, the examination of memes' persuasive effectiveness remains an underexplored area, limiting our understanding of their true impact on individuals and society. Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication that seeks to influence the beliefs, desires, and actions of an audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Nee and Maio, 2019)</ref>. Several research has emphasized the importance of assessing persuasive communication in the digital domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Trabelsi and Zaïane, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaech et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fahmy and Omneya (2021)</ref> highlighted the need for a comprehensive analysis of persuasive strategies employed in online visual content, including memes. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Seiffert-Brockmann and Diehl, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Seiffert-Brockmann et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nee and Maio, 2019)</ref> have highlighted the potential of memes to influence public opinion and disrupt political decision-making, thus emphasizing the need for thorough investigations into the persuasive nature of memes. However, despite the existing studies, there is still a gap in empirical research within the field of Natu- ral Language Processing (NLP) that systematically evaluates the persuasive effectiveness of memes and explores their persuasive strategies. Persuasive memes possess the power to influence society both positively and negatively. A positively persuasive meme is used to convey powerful messages, challenge norms, and advocate for social change (c.f. Example (e,f) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Contrarily, negatively persuasive memes can perpetuate harmful ideologies, spread misinformation, and manipulate emotions (c.f. Example (b,c) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Understanding the impact of persuasive memes is crucial in shaping public opinion and promoting responsible communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Nee and Maio, 2019)</ref>. This research addresses this gap by analyzing the persuasive effectiveness of memes, offering valuable insights for informed and ethical digital discourse. Code-mixing The widespread use of code-mixed memes on social media platforms presents a significant challenge for meme analysis and understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Edwards, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bali et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rijhwani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kamble and Joshi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ghanghor et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hossain et al., 2022)</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for persuasion identification for English-Hindi (Hinglish) code-mixing. In order to address this gap and facilitate research in this area, we have created a dataset of Hinglish memes across four domains, namely political, religious, racist, and sexist. This dataset enables the analysis and exploration of persuasive techniques in code-mixed memes and contributes to the understanding of the persuasive nature of Hinglish memes in various contexts. Our Contributions: In this paper, we study persuasive memes, and formulate three tasks. Task 1 (Persuasive meme detection): Given a meme, detect whether it is persuasive or not. Task 2 (Identification of the effectiveness of persuasive memes): Given a persuasive meme, analyze the various categories of persuasive impact, ranging from highly negative to highly positive persuasion. Task 3 (Use of persuasion techniques): Given a persuasive meme, identify which techniques are used to enhance the persuasiveness and impact. To this end, we develop a novel code-mixed Hinglish dataset, named Persuasive_meme, containing 6k real memes in the Indian scenario, which we collected from social media and carefully annotated. In our study, we meticulously develop comprehensive annotation guidelines for all three tasks. We extensively evaluate multiple state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal models to establish benchmark performance for these tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Persuasion detection in textual data: In the field of persuasion detection, researchers have shown significant interest in text-based analysis. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tan et al. (2014)</ref> investigated the influence of wording in predicting the popularity of social media content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guerini et al. (2015)</ref> explored the impact of sounds on persuasiveness by examining euphony and focused on the phonetic aspect rather than language usage. Park et al. ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>) developed an interactive system to assist human moderators in selecting high-quality news. Additionally, Reddit has become an important platform for research on social news analysis and recommendation, as demonstrated by previous studies exploring language use, community reactions, and comment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buntain and Golbeck, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaech et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tan et al., 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wei et al. (2016)</ref> investigated the identification of persuasive comments in online forums using several feature identification techniques. Persuasion detection in visual data: The advent of social media has driven researchers to incorporate images into their analyses to better understand persuasion and its intentions. Political science and mass media scholars have explored audiences' emotional and cognitive responses to televised images of political leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bucy and Bradley, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Masters et al., 1986)</ref> and investigated the selective use of images by the media for persuasive purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barnhurst and Steele, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grabe and Bucy, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Joo et al. (2014)</ref> have demonstrated the value of systematically examining communicative intents in uncovering deeper insights into the meaning and persuasive impact of images, transcending surface-level feature classification.</p><p>Other studies on memes: The widespread proliferation of memes and their increasing impact on online communication have recently sparked research interest in meme analysis in the NLP community. However, the existing efforts in meme analysis have primarily centered around identifying hateful or offensive memes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rijhwani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sharma et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kiela et al., 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Suryawanshi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hossain et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sharma et al., 2022)</ref>, or detection of propaganda techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dimitrov et al., 2021)</ref> with limited attention given to the identification of persuasive memes. Code-mixing: Furthermore, most of the existing works for memes in the code-mixed settings have been performed on textual data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kamble and Joshi, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bali et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mathur et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Tang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bohra et al., 2018)</ref>. Persuasiveness identification in multimodal, especially in Hinglish scenarios, is primarily unexplored due to inadequate resources and tools. As a result, there is a significant gap in the research landscape when it comes to identifying persuasive memes. This paper aims to address this gap by focusing specifically on the task of persuasive meme identification and exploring their impact on social media platforms, mainly in Hinglish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpus Creation</head><p>We create a new dataset due to the lack of an existing Hinglish dataset for persuasion identification in memes. During the preparation of this corpus (henceforth referred to as Persuasive_Meme), we take the following steps: (i) Data Collection, (ii) Annotation process, (iii) Annotation guidelines, and (iv) Data statistics. We discuss these steps below in more detail:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection</head><p>We collected memes covering various domains, such as politics, religion, and social issues like terrorism, racism, sexism, etc., using a list of 126 keywords (c.f. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). To keep a strategic distance from copyright issues, we only retrieved the freely available memes in the public domain with the help of a browser extension called Download All Images of Google's image search engine 3 . We finally retain only around 6K unique memes after removing the duplicates. (c.f. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for the data collection process.) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Annotation process</head><p>For the annotation purpose, we require experienced annotators with an expert-level understanding of the code-mixed Hindi-English language. The annotation team comprises of three highly qualified members, both male and female, 20-25 years old, who possessed undergraduate degrees and extensive experience in code-mixed Hindi-English and NLP research. Their expertise and fluency in the language ensured the quality of the annotation process. It is important to note that no incentives were provided to the annotators to maintain objectivity. Furthermore, we only included annotators familiar with the Indian scenario. To address this, we divided the process into three distinct phases: (i) Dry Run, (ii) Final Annotation, and (iii) Consolidation. Details of each step are described in the following sections.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Phase 1: Pre-processing and Text editing</head><p>The collected raw memes are (i). noisy such as background pictures are not clear, (ii) non-codemixed Hindi-English, i.e., meme texts are written in other languages except code-mixed Hindi-English, and (iii) non-multi-modal, i.e., memes contain either text or visual content. We manually discarded these memes to reduce manual data annotation effort. Next, we extracted the textual part of each meme using an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool: Tesseract 4 . The OCR errors are manually post-corrected by the annotators. Finally, we consider 6,000 memes for data annotation. The average meme text length for the memes samples in our dataset is between 10-20 words. (Refer to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> to see the plot. )</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Phase 2: Dry run</head><p>This stage is the pilot annotations to train the annotators to understand our annotation guidelines. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, we have shown our annotation interface. We annotated 200 samples on our own to use as a quality checker while evaluating the annotators' ability. We conducted a dry run on the same 200 memes, which helped the annotators understand well the definitions of all the labels, as well as eliminate the uncertainties/challenges about the annotation guidelines. For the preliminary data, one meme is annotated by three annotators. For Tasks 1 and task 2, we computed the inter-annotator agreement(IAA) in terms of Cohen's Kappa coefficient 4 github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract  <ref type="bibr">(Kiela et al., 2020b)</ref> Open English ✓ ✓ Offensive 10K Harmful meme <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sharma et al., 2022)</ref> Open English ✓ ✓ Offensive 3.5K Memotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Sharma et al., 2020)</ref> Open English ✓ ✓ Offensive 7K MAMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fersini et al., 2022)</ref> Misogynous English ✓ ✓ Offensive 10K MUTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hossain et al., 2022)</ref> Open CM Eng-Ben ✓ ✓ Offensive 4K Persuasive_memes (Ours)</p><p>Multi-domain Hinglish ✓ ✓ Persuasion/Effect/Technique 6K  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bernadt and Emmanuel, 1993)</ref>, and for Task 3 in a multilabel scenario, we reported Krippendorff's Alpha Coefficient (krippendorff, 2011). We average the Cohen's Kappa/Krippendorff's Alpha Coefficient score of all three annotators a i for i= 1 to 3 for each meme for all three tasks. It was observed that the initial scores for all three tasks were low (0.6529, 0.8097, and 0.5874), which is typical for a first pilot test. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Phase 3: Final Annotation</head><p>After phase 3.2.2, the training process was completed. Now, in this phase, we started the final annotation process. We asked the annotators to annotate a given meme with the correct label of each layer as given in the annotation guidelines. After confirming the validity of the meme, we proceed toward the consolidation phase of the annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Phase 4: Consolidation</head><p>Phase 3.2.4 is the process in which the annotations from phase 3.2.3 are consolidated. This step was critical for maintaining quality, as well as providing additional training for the entire team, which we found really beneficial. In the case of disagreements, we solved them by agreeing on a common point after a lot of discussions. At the end of this phase, we finally obtained the IAA score of 0.7197, 0.89380, and 0.69721, respectively, for all three tasks, which is interpreted as substantial agreement.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Annotation for identification of persuasive memes</head><p>Any meme will be annotated as Persuasive memes if it aims to influence or persuade individuals' attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wei et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Nee and Maio, 2019)</ref>. These memes typically employ various persuasive techniques such as metaphors, analogies, humor, satire, or manipulation of information to convey a particular message or agenda.</p><p>(Refer to samples (b-f) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). On the other hand, Non-persuasive memes refer to memes that do not have a specific persuasive intent. They are often created for entertainment purposes, to share jokes, and memes related to popular culture, or to simply evoke laughter without attempting to change opinions or promote a specific viewpoint. These memes may focus on humor, irony, or relatability without a deliberate persuasive agenda (Refer to sample (a) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Annotation for the effectiveness of persuasive meme</head><p>The measurement of effectiveness in persuasive interventions is crucial, yet it can be challenging to directly measure actual persuasiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Thomas et al., 2019)</ref>. To measure the persuasiveness of memes, we inlined our work with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kaptein et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Busch et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anagnostopoulou et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Oduor and Oinas-Kukkonen, 2017)</ref> and assess the perceived persuasiveness rather than directly measuring the persuasive impact. To achieve this, we employed three scaling items: Motivational, Appropriateness, and Effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Thomas et al., 2017)</ref>, to evaluate the impact of memes on society. To quantify the persuasive nature of memes based on these items, we employed the Likert scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Likert, 1932)</ref>, a known technique in the field of persuasion. This scale allowed annotators to rate their agreement or disagreement with statements, enabling us to quantify the level of persuasion perceived by the memes.</p><p>• -2: Strongly Disagree (Highly Negative Persuasion): Based on the evaluation of the above scaling items of persuasive memes, the annotators strongly disagree that these memes have a positive influence. They perceive such memes as highly negative and firmly believe that memes exert a strong negative impact on the target audience due to their use of aggressive tactics or manipulative strategies. (c.f. sample (a) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). • -1: Disagree (Moderately Negative Persuasion): Evaluating such persuasive memes, the annotators disagree that these memes have a positive impact. They find the memes moderately negative in their approach, as they employ fear appeals, problem identification, or social disapproval to discourage certain behaviors or beliefs. However, the annotators do not perceive these memes as excessively harmful or manipulative in nature (c.f. sample (b) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). • 0: Neutral (Neutral Persuasion): Annotators hold a neutral perception of persuasive memes, neither strongly positive nor negative. They perceive the memes as neither highly impactful nor devoid of influence. They view them as presenting information or arguments without a distinct positive or negative leaning (c.f. sample (c) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). • 1: Agree (Moderately Positive Persuasion):</p><p>Evaluating the above scaling items aspects of persuasive memes, the annotators agree that these memes have a moderately positive influence. They find the memes to be encouraging, educational, or empowering. However, it is important to acknowledge that while these moderately positive memes hold value and impact, they may not reach the same level of overwhelming positivity as those in the highly positive category (2) (c.f. sample (d) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). • 2: Strongly Agree (Highly Positive Persuasion): The annotators strongly agree that persuasive memes are remarkably positive, serving as a source of inspiration and effectively motivating individuals towards beneficial actions, attitudes, or beliefs. They firmly believe that these memes have a substantial positive impact on the target audience. (c.f. sample (e) and (f) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Annotation for the use of persuasion techniques</head><p>For this task, the annotation process requires annotators to thoroughly analyze the rhetorical strategies employed in the creation of persuasive memes and annotate the memes accordingly. It involves identifying and labeling all relevant rhetorical devices in a multi-label scenario, as they are instrumental in enhancing the persuasive nature of the meme. By annotating the rhetorical devices, we gain a deeper understanding of the persuasive techniques utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burgers et al., 2016)</ref> and their contribution to the overall persuasive impact of the meme.</p><p>• Metaphors (1): Comparisons that highlight similarities between two things are used to make complex ideas more accessible, relatable, and persuasive in memes. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Task Definition</head><p>In this paper, we aim at solving three tasks individually using a deep-learning framework: (i) t1: Persuasive meme detection, (ii) t2: Identification of the effectiveness of persuasive meme, and (iii) t3: Identification of persuasion techniques. Let every meme S i ∈ {T, V} is a set with text T i = (t i 1 , t i 2 , ...., t i k ), and image I i with the shape (224,224,3) in RGB pattern. In the i th meme, k refers to the total number of words in the textual part of the meme. Our goal is to predict the correct label of each task, i.e., ŷt1 ⊆{persuasive, non-persuasive}, ŷt2 ⊆{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} and ŷt3 ⊆{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for each S i . The purpose of this task is to maximize the value of the following function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">argmax θ tk Π n i=0 Π k j=0 P ŷi tk | S i ; θ tk (1)</formula><p>where tk is the current task in {t1, t2, t3}, S i is the current meme, P is the log-likelihood, and θ is the model parameter which is needed to be optimized.</p><p>5 Baseline Models</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Unimodal Systems</head><p>For the text-based baseline model, we implement LSTM with FastText embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bojanowski et al., 2016)</ref>(L_FT), LSTM with Character level Encoding (L_Char), m-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pires et al., 2019)</ref>, LaBSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Feng et al., 2020)</ref>, Muril <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Khanuja et al., 2021)</ref>, Indic_BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kakwani et al., 2020)</ref>, VGG-19 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015), ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(He et al., 2015)</ref>, ViT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Multimodal Systems</head><p>Early Fusion: For this category, we extract textual and visual features from different pretrained models and then applied early fusion to get a multimodal representation. By doing so, we develop the following baseline models: L_Char+VGG, L_FT+VGG, mBERT+ViT, LaBSE++ViT, Muril+ViT and Indic BERT+ViT Pre-trained Models: For the pre-trained multimodal system, we used the following pretrained models to extract the multimodal features: LXMERT (Tan and Bansal, 2019), VisualBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Li et al., 2019)</ref>. Further, we used another three multimodal feature extractors (mCLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Radford et al., 2021)</ref>, BLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Li et al., 2022)</ref>, and ALBEF <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>, M3P <ref type="bibr">(Ni et al., 2020)</ref>). Each of their features is passed through a projection layer to make the final predictions for Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental setups</head><p>We evaluate our proposed architecture on our curated dataset. Details of each task's train and test set distribution are given in the Appendix Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and 6. The optimal hyperparameters for our model are found using grid search. we have used Pytorch Lightning 5 framework for the implementation. We use Adam optimizer with weight decay (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 3e-5 for all the models. We train the model for 60 epochs with 64 batch sizes and early-stopping callback. We consistently use a 32 batch size while training with a fixed random seen of 123. All the models are trained for 20 epochs, and we take the last checkpoint to evaluate the baselines. A single NVIDIA Tesla GPU is used to conduct the experiments.</p><p>7 Results and Analysis</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Model results and comparison</head><p>In this section, we show the results that outline the comparison between several baseline models.</p><p>For evaluation of our tasks in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, we use the F1 score (F1-score), accuracy (A), and hamming loss (H-loss) as the preferred metrics. The results from Table <ref type="table">4</ref> provide valuable insights into the performance of different models in the three persuasion tasks. In Task 1, the baseline models L_FT and L_Char have low accuracy scores, while pre-trained models like m-BERT, LaBSE, Muril, and Indic BERT achieved higher accuracy scores, indicating their superior performance in classifying memes as persuasive or non-persuasive due to their ability to capture language patterns and contextual information. In Task 2, baseline models had limited performance in identifying the effect of persuasiveness. However, the pre-trained models VisualBERT and M3P achieved higher accuracy scores of 58.75% and 60.63%, respectively. These results indicate that these models were effective in capturing the nuanced effects conveyed by persuasive memes, outperforming the baseline models in understanding the impact of persuasiveness. For Task 3, which focused on identifying persuasion techniques, the baseline models showed modest performance. Among the pre-trained models, M3P achieved the highest accuracy score of 58.62%. This suggests that M3P successfully captured the distinctive persuasion techniques used in the memes, highlighting the importance of leveraging pre-trained models for identifying specific persuasive strategies. Overall, the M3P model, with multimodal features, outperforms the baseline models in all three persuasion tasks, emphasizing the importance of analyzing both textual and visual aspects of persuasive memes, and its success can be attributed to capturing contextual information, linguistic nuances and visual cues essential for understanding persuasive impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Modality Importance</head><p>In this section, we highlight the significance of incorporating both textual and visual modalities in the identification of persuasive memes. By leveraging both modalities, we can access complementary information that enhances our ability to discern the intent and meaning of a meme. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>(i) (a) in the Appendix, we illustrate how relying solely on the textual modality falls short of understanding the persuasiveness of the meme. However, when we incorporate multimodal information, the M3P model gains access to hidden cues of persuasiveness, leading to accurate labeling for Task 1. Similarly, in the case of sample (b) in Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> (i), relying solely on the visual modality proves insufficient in capturing the hidden cues of the meme. But once again, with the inclusion of multimodal information, the model successfully identifies the correct label for Task 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Explainability and Diagnostics</head><p>After training, our M3P model utilizes contextual information within the memes to justify its predictions. Using the LIME (Dieber and Kirrane, 2020) technique; we provide locally interpretable and human-understandable explanations for our model's predictions. In the first meme (In Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>), the M3P model correctly predicts the persuasive and negatively persuasive labels based on specific super-pixels corresponding to the person's face and words like "Mitro{Friends}" and "Fek{Throw}" in the text. These visual and textual elements convey persuasive intent and negative connotations. Similarly, in the second meme (In Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>), the M3P model accurately predicts the meme as both persuasive and negatively persuasive, with certain super-pixels representing the person's face and phrases, such as "Dilo me apni betabiyaan" (restlessness in your hearts) and "4-5 backlogs lekar chal rhe ho to Engineer ho tum" (if you are moving forward with 4-5 backlogs, then you are an Engineer) playing a significant role. These findings demonstrate how the M3P model effectively incorporates visual and textual cues to make precise predictions based on the persuasive and negative characteristics of the memes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Error Analysis</head><p>In our analysis of the error prediction of our topperforming model (M3P), we identify categories contributing to misclassification and analyze the reasons for these errors: (i) Lack of contextual knowledge: The first category relates to cases where the textual and visual components do not provide enough background or domain-related information. As a result, the model considers these memes as non-persuasive, despite their superficial persuasive nature, simply because of the absence of contextual/domain-related knowledge (c.f. sample (a) and (b) in the Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</p><p>(ii) Lack of common sense knowledge: The second category involves a lack of common sense knowledge, where our model struggles to intuitively reason about everyday situations and events, resulting in incorrect predictions of the persuasive class. (c.f. sample (c) in the Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</p><p>(iii) Due to the longer sentence length: In the third category, misclassifications occur when the sentence length is longer than the average, as illustrated in sample (d) in the Appendix Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, while internet memes have become ubiquitous in the digital landscape, their persuasive effectiveness remains a significant, yet underexplored area of research. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of persuasive memes, offering valuable insights into their impact on society and their potential to shape public opinion. By filling this void in the current literature, the research presented here seeks to advance our understanding of persuasive communication in the digital age, fostering informed discussions and facilitating responsible meme usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation</head><p>In Section 8, we discussed the limitations of our proposed work. Our baseline models struggle with the detection of subtle or implicit persuasive elements in memes. Some persuasive techniques may be context-dependent or rely on cultural references that are difficult for the models to capture accurately. By analyzing these errors, we gain valuable insights into the limitations and challenges faced by our model, which can guide future improvements in persuasive meme identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics and Broader Impact</head><p>Individual Privacy The resources we created for this study were derived from publicly available memes, and we strictly adhered to the restrictions on data usage to avoid any infringement of copyright laws. Furthermore, our study was evaluated and approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). We plan to make our code and data accessible for research purposes, subject to appropriate data agreement procedures, upon acceptance of our study.</p><p>To maintain the anonymity of any individual, we replaced the actual name with Person-XYZ throughout the paper. In addition, we also tried to anonymize the known faces presented in the visual part of the meme by masking them. We have masked these faces only to maintain the anonymity issues in the paper. During the implementation, we used the original image.</p><p>Biases Detecting and removing political and religious biases is an extensive research area. However, previous annotation studies show that we cannot correctly remove bias and subjectivity from the annotation process despite having some form of annotation scheme. However, any biases detected in our dataset are unintentional, and we have no intention of harming any individual or group. We ensure that our data collection is generated equally and comparably in order to answer any political and religious bias queries. Furthermore, we ensure that the topic includes various issues relevant to the Indian context over the last seven years by using a keywordbased data-gathering technique. Moreover, we made sure that the terms included were inclusive of all the conceivable politicians, political organizations, young politicians, extreme groups, and religions and were not prejudiced against any one group. Based on previous work done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Davidson et al., 2019)</ref> to remove biases from the dataset during annotation, in our dataset, annotators were strictly instructed not to make decisions based on what they believe but on what the social media user wants to transmit through that meme.</p><p>Misuse Potential We suggest that researchers be aware that our dataset might be abused to filter the memes based on prejudices that may or may not be connected to demographics or other textual information. To prevent this from happening, human intervention with moderation would be essential. Intended Use Our dataset is presented to encourage research into studying persuasive memes on the internet. We believe that it represents a valuable resource when used appropriately.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples from our Persuasive_meme dataset.
