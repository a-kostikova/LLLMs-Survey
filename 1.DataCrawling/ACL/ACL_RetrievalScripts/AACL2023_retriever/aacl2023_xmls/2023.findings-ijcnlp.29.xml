<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Prompt-based classifiers are an attractive approach for zero-shot classification. However, the precise choice of the prompt template and label words can largely influence performance, with semantically equivalent settings often showing notable performance difference. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to word biases, where the classifier may be biased towards classes. To address this problem, it is possible to optimise classification thresholds on a labelled data set, however, this mitigates some of the advantages of prompt-based classifiers. This paper instead approaches this problem by examining the expected marginal probabilities of the classes. Here, probabilities are reweighted to have a uniform prior over classes, in an unsupervised fashion. Further, we draw a theoretical connection between the class priors and the language models' word prior, and offer the ability to set a threshold in a zero-resource fashion. We show that matching class priors correlates strongly with the oracle upper bound performance and demonstrate large consistent performance gains for prompt settings over a range of NLP tasks. 1</p></div>

LLMs can effectively handle a range of NLP tasks through 'prompting', where a natural language instruction is added to the input, conditioning the model to the task at hand. Prompting can either be an emergent ability learned through scaling up model size <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brown et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wei et al., 2022)</ref> or an ability learned through instruction tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Wei et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chung et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ouyang et al., 2022)</ref>.

Previous works have demonstrated that prompt templates can significantly impact task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Shin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Zhou et al.)</ref> and that factors such as chosen label words can influence system performance for classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zhao et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Holtzman et al., 2021)</ref>. This work focuses on the influence of 'word biases' for prompt-based classifiers. i.e. the bias that prompts may have towards certain classes, independent of the input text. To account for this bias, one could use a labelled dataset to find optimal class decision thresholds. This, however, requires labelled task data, which may limit the zero-shot benefits of prompt-based classifiers. We propose a simple unsupervised solution of re-weighting probabilities, where we use unlabelled data to search for weight parameters that ensure a uniform prior over classes. We show that this prior matching leads to greater robustness for diverse prompt settings and that the unsupervised weights which debias the classifier is highly correlated with the oracle weights that maximise accuracy. Further, we provide theoretical analysis that draws a connection between word priors and inherent class bias, which we use to motivate a zero-resource normalisation approach that is competitive with prior matching. Overall, we demonstrate that our unsupervised approach highly reduces sensitivity to the chosen prompt and label words, and that settings which initially fail can often be made effective through a simple probability re-weighting.</p><p>Our contributions are 1) We propose a simple unsupervised probability re-weighting method, and empirically demonstrate greater robustness to prompt and label word choice, with large accuracy gains across prompt settings for a range of standard NLP tasks. 2) We theoretically connect the weight parameters to word priors and use this to motivate a zero-resource re-weighting approach. 3) We show that the weights of prior matching are highly correlated with the optimal oracle weights that maximize accuracy, illustrating that our approach is a near-optimal use of a system's output probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Mitigating Bias by Re-weighting</head><p>Prompt-based classifiers Given an input sequence x ∈ X , large language models (LLMs) model P θ (w|x), the output probability distribution over all possible sequences w ∈ X . For a classification task T , a prompt-based classifier 1) reformats the input text x to prompt p ∈ X by including the task instruction, and 2) selects class words {w k } 1:K which are associated to each output class {y k } 1:K . For example in sentiment classification, one can use prompt 'what is the sentiment of the following review? &lt;x&gt;', (where &lt;x&gt; is the current input x, e.g. 'Inception was absolutely brilliant'), and class words w 0 =bad and w 1 =good for the negative and positive classes respectively. For a prompt classifier, Q = {p, {w k } 1:K }, class probabilities can be set to be proportional to the probability of the associated class word, where the final decision ŷ is the class with the highest probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Zhao et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jiang et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Pθ (y k |x, Q) = P θ (w k |p(x)</formula><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w i P θ (w i |p(x))</formula><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ŷ = argmax k Pθ (y k |x, Q) (2)</formula><p>However, as a large language model, the promptbased classifier may return probabilities that are influenced by distributional statistics of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Gardner et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liusie et al., 2022)</ref>. This may lead to inherent class bias, where label words may have high probability not because they better answer the prompt, but because they have a high LM prior.</p><p>Optimal Weights To account for this, one can define weight parameters α = {α k } 1:K , where each α k ∈ R + scales the probabilities of the classifier,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Pθ (y k |x, Q, α) = α k Pθ (y k |x, Q) i α i Pθ (y i |x, Q)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Given labelled task dataset D = {(x (j) , y (j) )} N j=1 , one can then find the optimal weights α * that maximises the accuracy of the prompt classifier Pθ (y k |x, Q, α) over the dataset,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">α * = argmax α Accuracy(Q, α, D)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Prior-Matching The previous approach requires labelled data, which may limit the benefit of using prompt-based classifiers. As an alternative, one can find the values ᾱ that ensure that the classifier is unbiased, such that the class prior P (y k |Q, α) matches the true prior P (y k )</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Pθ (y k |Q, α) = E x { Pθ (y k |x, Q, α)} (5) ≈ 1 N N j=1</formula><p>Pθ (y</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(j) k |x (j) , Q, α) (6) ᾱ = argmin α ∀y k | Pθ (y k |Q, α) -P (y k )| (7)</formula><p>A deterministic solution that exactly matches the distributions exists, which can be found with a search with 1 degree of freedom (that can be accounted for by setting α 1 = 1). If there is no expected class bias, one can assume equal probabilities over all classes, P (y k ) = U(y k ) = 1 N . This approach is therefore unsupervised and only requires text inputs D x = {x (j) } M j=1 , which therefore can be applied at inference to any test set.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Experimental Results</head><p>Classification Robustness Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the mean and standard deviation of accuracies among all prompt and class word settings for a given task. We observe large consistent gains from both re-weighting approaches, with prior-matching increasing baseline accuracy by between 6.7% to 12.1% for sentiment classification, 13.7% for qqp, and over 25% for natural language inference. Prior-matching also demonstrates performance very similar to the oracle upper-bound, often within 1%, showing that the unsupervised prior-match approach is competitive with the supervised threshold search. Prior-matching also performs better than null-input by a small margin in all tasks, where this small gap confirms that the word-prior normalisation is a very reasonable zero-shot approximation.</p><p>Prompt Robustness Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates a boxplot of rotten tomatoes performance over all classwords for each considered method, over all 6 prompts. As observed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, naively using raw label word probabilities (dark blue) leads to considerable fluctuations in accuracy; some prompt and label word settings lead to reasonable accuracy (92%+ accuracy), however there is observed brittleness to label word choice, with many settings demonstrating poor performance. Prior matching (green) leads to significant robustness, with nearly all sensible settings above 85% accuracy. We further find that, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the unsupervised approach has accuracies very comparable to those Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: boxplots of the accuracy of all label-word pairs for rotten tomatoes, over all the considered prompts when using optimal thresholds. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>, we consider similar boxplots for SNLI and observe larger gains through reweighting. This was as higher probabilities are often assigned to the entailment and contradiction labels words, leading to under-classification of the neutral class. We observe greater sensitivity to prompt choice and label words for snli than as observed in rotten tomatoes, even with reweighting. Weight Alignment Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> shows a scatter plot of the weights found by the optimal threshold search α * (equation 4), with those found from the unsupervised prior matching method ᾱ (equation 7) and the zero-resource word prior approximation (equation 9). We see a clear linear relationship between optimal and prior-match, illustrating that accounting for the marginal bias is almost equivalent with maximising accuracy, however, achieved in an unsupervised fashion. Null-input is also well correlated with the optimal thresholds, but there is a less direct relationship. Similar linear relationships are observed also for other binary-classification tasks and prompts, as shown in Appendix C. This paper analyzes prompt-based classifiers and demonstrates that inherent class bias is a significant factor that influences the sensitivity of the system to prompt and label words. We propose an unsupervised approach of prior matching, which we demonstrate performs competitively to the supervised alternative of searching for optimal thresholds, while avoiding the need for labelled data. We relate prior matching with word biases, and motivate a zero-resource approach of debiasing model probabilities. We show that our methods lead to practical approaches that reduce the sensitivity to design choices such as prompts and label words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>This work considered sentiment classification, natural language inference, and paraphrase detection, and could have been extended over a greater suite of tasks to guarantee its effectiveness. Further, this paper ran experiments on FlanT5 and Llama2, and this work has not yet explored a larger range of prompted language models. FlanT5 has also been instruction-tuned on similar tasks, so the findings may be limited in scenarios where known capabilities have to be elicited from models robustly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Considerations</head><p>Though this work suggests methods to improve the robustness of prompt-based classifiers to prompts and label words, this does not imply that all design choices will work. In some set ups, the system may be ineffective and have poor generalisation over the task. Deploying machine learning classifiers in realworld classification settings has many associated risks, and careful analysis should be made before deploying such systems.</p></div>
