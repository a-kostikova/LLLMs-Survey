<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>News is read and consumed differently based on its topic and timeliness to the reader. Some stories attract readers immediately after they are published, while others capture readership consistently over multiple days after their publication, regardless of their overall popularity. This paper studies this less explored facet of news story consumption, which we name persistence, operationalized as the time for a story to reach a certain percent of its total interest. In particular, we study persistence though a novel, publicly available data set of news tweets from 353 news outlets. We perform an extensive linguistic analysis of persistence in social media to uncover the underlying topical and stylistic cues that impact short-or long-term interest in a story. We train several models for predicting persistence that achieve predictive performance of up to 0.353 Spearman correlation when extrapolating to tweets from days unseen in training and retain significant predictive performance even on tweets from accounts unseen in training. The ability to predict news persistence can be useful in several practical applications that drive news and social media consumption including alerting, search ranking or recommendations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The vast majority of news outlets follow a 24-hour news cycle to meet the demand for covering news consistently at every hour daily. Combined with the advent of online news and social media, users are thus now faced with a constant onslaught of news stories <ref type="bibr">(Foundation, 2020)</ref>. Faced with limited user time, past research focused on identifying important stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Szabo and Huberman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandari et al., 2012)</ref> or recommending stories to specific users <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borges and Lorena, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Özgöbek et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>News story persistence is a characteristic of news stories that is distinct from its overall popularity * Work done during an internship at Bloomberg. or its relevance to the reader. User interest is dependent on the content and type of the news story: some stories require the reader's immediate attention, such as breaking stories caused by political statements impacting day-to-day activities, financial markets or updates on a natural disaster; while other stories have interest more spread out over time, such as opinions or lifestyle content.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates examples of stories of shortterm (low persistence) and long-term (high persistence) interest expressed through news tweets. The short-term interest stories contain breaking news. These attracted immediate interest from users, with the majority of the total interest for the story amassed within 1 hour of their publication time, as the stories were actionable and, potentially, other stories or posts were written later to provide a more detailed analysis. One of the long-term interest stories provides a deeper analysis or report, with interest continuing even after a day of its pub-lication time, as this content is not as time sensitive. The other long-term interest story contains information that is relevant well after publication (e.g., highlights of a competition), thus attracting sustained interest over time. We highlight that persistence is distinct from the overall popularity of a story, as both types of stories can either be of narrow interest attracting little total readership (e.g., volleyball competition) or can be of broad interest (e.g., security network report). Contributions The goal of this paper is to study the persistence of news, as represented by news tweets, through their textual content alone at story publication time. The persistence of a news tweet is measured through the time in which it reaches a specific percent of its total interest. Our contributions include: • A data set of news tweets associated with interest time series, extracted from a wide range of official news Twitter accounts. • Correlation analysis showing that persistence is a distinct concept to popularity. • An extensive quantitative analysis of the topics and linguistic features related to persistence. • Experiments on predicting persistence at news tweet publication time from textual features that reach a predictive score of 0.445 Spearman correlation on held-out stories. • Evaluation of persistence models on data from future time intervals which achieve 0.353 Spearman correlation. These show promise towards generalizability in a realistic scenario, when training is done frequently using the latest data and predictions happen on data from unseen future time periods. Due to the nature of our problem framing, we only consider features available at story publication time, such as text. We consider outside the scope of this study the use non-textual information such as information about the identities and features of the authors, use of information from other modalities (e.g. images), as well as information about early interest in the story or cascades. Applications Accurately predicting persistence of a story at publication time can lead to many direct applications such as: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Ranking Tweets. Ranking tweets is a well studied problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Nagmoti et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Soboroff et al., 2012a,b)</ref> and relevance is often correlated with the overall popularity of the post as measured through existing retweet counts or the authoritativeness of the source <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Duan et al., 2010)</ref>. In addition, aging theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al., 2003)</ref> was proposed for events, wherein a particular event receives boosts in interest when there are new stories about it, while also aging with a factor as time elapses. We expect that our predicted persistence factor will help better identify and surface relevant content, especially in domains such as finance, where timeliness and novelty are major characteristics of relevant news <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ceccarelli et al., 2016)</ref>. Cascade Prediction. Cascade prediction aims to model future popularity and sharing patterns of a post based on sharing history up to a point-in-time. This is based on the observation that early rates of popularity are indicative of longer term trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Szabo and Huberman, 2010)</ref>. Models to predict cascades usually rely on features derived from past shares such as structural network features, resharer features (e.g., influence in the network) and temporal features (e.g., times between reshares) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheng et al., 2014)</ref>, as well as features derived from the content of the post such as text <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hong et al., 2011)</ref> and poster information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cheng et al., 2014)</ref>. Several methods are proposed to model arrival times of retweets given past tweet history <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zaman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rizoiu et al., 2017)</ref>, with time being modeled to account for the circadian nature of users and information decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kobayashi and Lambiotte, 2016)</ref>. Work in this area is complementary to our approach which only uses the textual information available at story publication time. Comparing and combining they two types of approaches would be relevant future work.</p><p>Popularity Prediction. A popular related area of past research is popularity prediction. The goal is to predict the upcoming popularity of a news story or tweet measured through metrics such as total retweet counts, irrespective of when these were obtained compared to the posting time. The prediction is performed at posting time using features such as text <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Petrovic et al., 2011)</ref>, images <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>, social relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Petrovic et al., 2011)</ref>, time of posting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yu et al., 2015)</ref> and account information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandari et al., 2012)</ref>. The task is framed as either classification, where the goal is to predict if the target item will have popularity above a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Jenders et al., 2013)</ref> or receives a response <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tsagkias et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Petrovic et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Artzi et al., 2012)</ref> or as regression or ordinal regression, with popularity intervals as the target value <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Yu et al., 2015)</ref>. A related thread is predicting if an article receives comments or responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Yano et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yano and Smith, 2010)</ref>, while also factoring in past account behavior and interests <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Zhang et al., 2016)</ref>. The impact of wording on tweet popularity was studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Tan et al., 2014)</ref> using tweets that have similar content, but were worded differently, uncovering significant predictive effects.</p><p>The only paper to study a related concept defined as persistence is <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Wu et al., 2011)</ref>, which studies the decay rate of URLs embedded in tweets by categorizing into two classes based on their shape after peak interest. Our paper presents a new more fine-grained operationalization of the concept as a regression task. We focus on a realistic setup that avoids feature leakage and emphasises model generalizability. We also introduce a more suitable public data set for the task by focusing on news tweets from a variety of sources and aim to avoid potential effects caused by measuring the network diffusion of content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Task &amp; Data</head><p>We define a news story's persistence as the time that elapses between its publication time and the time the collective interest reaches T% of its total interest. Note that our persistence metric only relates to the shape of the user interest in a story and is thus distinct to the story's popularity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection</head><p>We create a new publicly available data set to study this task, as no other public data set is available. We release the persistence score with each tweet, as well as the full distribution of retweets across time used to compute the persistence score. We use Twitter as the source of our data since the vast majority of news outlets also maintain a Twitter account where they disseminate short news stories to users that use Twitter for reading news. Additionally, at least at the time of the data collection, tweets were mostly displayed to users in temporal order. Finally, Twitter maintains a public API which we can poll regularly to obtain a time series of the number of retweets over time.</p><p>We perform our analysis on a set of 353 major news accounts that publish news in English. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> The list of accounts covers a variety of news sources including major local, national and international outlets across a variety of English-speaking locations.</p><p>We use the Twitter API<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> to regularly poll the timelines of all target accounts. Every time we poll, we obtain an updated retweet count and create a time series consisting of the number of retweets of a tweet over time. We use regular 15 minutes intervals to re-collect the same tweets due to Twitter API rate limit restrictions, which also impacts the number of tweets and accounts we can monitor. We argue this does not impact any of the core findings about the concept of persistence, as the content is from diverse accounts, or the text-based methods used to model this concept, as these can be readily applied if other data is available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Interest Metric</head><p>Over 98% of retweets on Twitter occur within the 72 hours after the tweet was posted. Hence, we compute total interest within the first 72 hours after publication time.  Each time we poll an account, we retrieve a time series of the number of retweets or likes of each tweet on that account. We found that aggregated retweet and favourite counts have a correlation of r = 0.999 (p &lt; 0.001)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , suggesting the two metrics are highly coupled. Hence, in the rest of the paper, we use the total number of retweets a news tweet received as a proxy for interest.</p><p>On average, interest in tweets accumulates very fast. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, over half of the tweets in our dataset reached 60% of their total interest (retweets) within the first hour of publication. We also looked at the distribution of tweets at other T% thresholds, where T ∈ [50, 60, 70, 80]<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates that the persistence scores based on each threshold value have high correlation with each other. When T = 60, the distribution has highest mean correlation with other thresholds with minimum deviation. Hence, in the rest of the paper, we define persistence as the amount of time it takes for a story to reach 60% of the total number of retweets it will obtain in the first 72 hours after publication. We also studied the shapes of the interest metric and noticed that most followed a similar pattern, with a burst in interest soon after publication, fol-lowed by a decay, with rarely any other significant burst during the decay stage. This evidence further supports our metric choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Processing</head><p>To assemble the final data set, we apply the following processing steps. First, we only keep tweets posted in English, as identified by the langid.py tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lui and Baldwin, 2012)</ref>. To focus on original content posted by the account, we remove quoted tweets and retweets. If an account publishes a link to the same news story multiple times, we only keep the first tweet in chronological order. We discard the subsequent tweets and associated interest since it would lead to artificially increased interest. Finally, to remove time series having small counts with noisy persistence estimates, we drop all tweets with less than 20 likes and retweets combined.</p><p>We process the tweet texts by lower-casing, replacing all URLs and anonymizing all mentions of usernames with a placeholder token. We tokenize tweet text using the DLATK Twitter-aware tokenizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Schwartz et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Data Set and Splits</head><p>Our final data set consists of 9104 unique tweets from 353 unique news Twitter accounts. In order to test that a predictive model of persistence is robust and able to extrapolate on unseen data, as in a real scenario, we create the following experimental setups: measure the gap in generalization induced by the previous more challenging, but realistic scenarios.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the distribution of the persistence score we will aim to predict at news publication time. The mean persistence time is 2.227 hours, while the median time is 0.861 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis</head><p>This section details the analysis we performed on our dataset to discover and understand factors impacting persistence of news tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Difference between Persistence and Popularity</head><p>We first aim to study the quantitative difference between persistence and popularity as they are defined as distinct concepts: popularity measures overall interest in a story, while persistence measures the temporal pattern of interest. In this setup, we can use the total number of retweets of a tweet as a proxy for its popularity. A correlation test uncovers a small correlation between the overall interest (total retweets) and the persistence score (time spent to reach 60% of total retweets) with r = 0.131, p &lt; .0001. This illustrates that there is a relationship between popular tweets and tweets with higher persistence, albeit the effect size is small, proving these metrics operationalize distinct concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Account Statistics</head><p>Next, we study the relationship between account identity and persistence. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> displays the distribution of tweets in our data set across accounts. We see that only a couple of accounts have more than 250 tweets, with most accounts having between 10-50 tweets (&gt;80%), with an average of 25.7 tweets per account. This shows that the data set is not dominated by content from a few prolific accounts and that our analysis may uncover more general patterns of persistence. with ≥ 10 tweets in our data set in order to remove noise associated with this statistic when the average is computed over a small number of tweets.</p><p>We notice that accounts that post stories with low persistence include accounts that: a) specialize in breaking news (e.g. NewsBreaking, BreakingNews), which is natural as their goal is to publish stories that need to be read quickly after publication; b) specialize in finance news (e.g. SEC_News, ReutersBiz, WSJ), which is intuitive as financial stories move markets and quick reactions are common; c) are a popular publishing house (e.g. guardiannews, NBCNews, PTI_News).</p><p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, the main pattern emerging is regarding accounts of news from organizations or governmental authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAANews), the New York Police department (NYPDnews) or Amazon (amazonnews). Posts from these accounts are less time critical for their readers as, on a closer analysis, they are more likely to contain information about the organization or are advertising their operations.</p><p>We quantitatively study the relationship between the popularity of an account, measured through its number of followers, and news tweet persistence. A correlation test uncovers a statistically significant correlation between the number of followers and persistence (r = -0.124, p &lt; .0001), highlighting that tweets from more followed accounts attract quick interest from users.</p><p>Finally, we also measure the relationship between the number of posts of an account and its average persistence score. A correlation test shows there is a statistically significant correlation between the two (r = -0.205, p &lt; .0002), highlighting that the accounts that publish more content have a lower average persistence score, which means more tweets attract quick interest from users. This could be an effect of tweets being harder to access in the interface by users given the larger volume of tweets from that account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Time of Publication</head><p>As tweet publication and consumption varies across time (Statista, 2014), we study if there is any interplay between the persistence score and tweet publish time. Metrics of popularity were found to be predictable from tweets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Petrovic et al., 2011)</ref> or in the case of the Digg platform which consisted largely of news stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Szabo and Huberman, 2010)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the distribution of persistence score according to tweet publication hour of day in UTC. The histogram shows no consistent pattern between the two indicators, with a correlation value of -0.023 (p = 0.915). This highlights that publication time may not be a useful feature to model when trying to predict the persistence score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Linguistic Analysis</head><p>Our final analysis studies the linguistic features associated with persistence in news tweets. We perform this analysis using the following feature sets: Unigrams We use bag-of-words to represent each tweet as a normalised frequency distribution over the vocabulary consisting of all words used in at least 5 different tweets (5278 tokens) GloVe Clusters An alternative to bag-of-word features is to represent each tweet as a distribution over group of words that are semantically and/or syntactically similar. The clusters help reducing the feature space and provides additional interpretability to the analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2015)</ref>. Each tweet is thereby represented as a frequency distribution over these categories.</p><p>To conduct the analysis, we use the method from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Schwartz et al., 2013)</ref> and used in several other linguistic analyses of user traits or speech acts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Preoţiuc-Pietro et al., 2019)</ref>. We rank the feature sets previously described using univariate Pearson correlation. Features are normalized to sum up to unit for each tweet. For each feature, we compute correlations independently between its distribution across posts and the persistence score of the tweet.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> presents the top unigrams and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> presents the top clusters correlated with low and high persistence. The results uncover clear patterns regarding the type of content that attracts quick interest, thus resulting in low persistence: news about violent events (e.g. 'accused' -clusters denoted by their top word), political stories (dominated by US events in our data e.g. congress, president, trump, impeachment, ukraine) and stories about the economy. In addition, keywords such as 'breaking' and 'updates' are indicative of stories that are deemed breaking also by editors and stories that update ongoing breaking events.</p><p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, stories with high persistence show less distinctive patterns, albeit stories referring to people such as interviews or quotes ('his', 'saying') stand out. In addition, common words (e.g. 'and, 'the', 'our') hint that these stories are better edited and formed as compared to breaking stories, while words indicative of questions (e.g. 'can', 'will', 'how') show that analysis stories have higher persistence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Predicting Persistence</head><p>Finally, we experiment with a series of approaches to predicting the persistence score of unseen news tweets including both linear models and models using pretrained contextual embedding models. We train regression models with three diverse scenarios of data splits as detailed in Section 3.4. For source split and random split, we train and evaluate performance over ten runs using different random splits for Twitter accounts and tweets respectively. For temporal split, we train and evaluate over ten runs using different random seeds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Methods</head><p>Linear Model We use a linear regression model<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">5</ref> with Elastic Net regularization tuned on the development set. We use the textual features from the tweet text as represented by the GloVe cluster to   which they belong. We also create features from the Twitter account, as Section 4.2 showed there is a relationship between Twitter account and average persistence. Thus, similarly to the tweet text representation, we create an additional distinct bagof-cluster representation from the Twitter account description and the number of followers associated with the account as an additional numerical feature.</p><p>In the learning stage, we fine-tune the linear regression model for 1000 epochs using the stopping criteria tol, regularization multiplier α, prediction accuracy threshold ϵ, and L1 ratio. We use dimension 200 text features created using GloVe 200 clusters based on preliminary results. When splitting the data by source, we use tol = 1e-3, α = 1e-5, ϵ= 0.5, and L1_ratio = 0.4. When splitting the data by publication time, we use tol = 1e-7, α = 1e-5, ϵ = 0.5, and L1_ratio = 1. When splitting the data randomly, we use tol = 1e-5, α = 1e-7, ϵ = 0.5, and L1_ratio = 0.</p><p>BERT In addition to the linear modes, we also utilize BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> as a representative for Transformer-based models. In our experiment, we fine-tune the model for persistence prediction with an output dense layer for regression. Similar to the Linear Regression model, we consider possible feature influence of textual inputs from tweet text and account description and follower numbers from tweet metadata. The numerical value of follower number is concatenated with pooled output vector of BERT before passing to the regression layer.</p><p>We fine-tuned the model for persistence prediction with pre-trained Bert-base-cased model (12layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameter) for 3 epochs. The initial learning rate is set to 5e-5 and the batch size in training is set to 16. Additional details for facilitating reproducibility are presented in Section B in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref> shows the results of predictive models averaged across 10 runs. Results are measured using standard correlation metrics such as Spearman ρ, Pearson r and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Models are tuned to obtain best Spearman ρ in the development set.  In all three experimental setups, the results show that both linear regression and BERT models predict persistence consistently above random chance, even on data from unseen time intervals and from unseen sources.</p><p>The results show that the model with pre-trained contextual embeddings outperforms linear regression model with handcrafted features, with an average Spearman correlation increase of 0.05 on the source split, 0.07 on the temporal split and 0.12 on the random split.</p><p>Results from the temporal split show that the model for predicting persistence can generalize on future data than that used in training. The models achieve a Spearman correlation of 0.353 (BERT) and of 0.285 (Linear Regression). This setup is the most realistic for real-world applications, where data from sources of interest are available for training, but the predictions are on future data from a time range not observed in training. This performance is naturally lower than on the random split setup where there is a temporal and source overlap that the model can leverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Huang and Paul, 2018)</ref>. Our results highlight the importance of model retraining using the most recent data.</p><p>The effect of source drift introduces the largest impact on model performance with Spearman correlation dropping to 0.167 from 0.445 (BERT) and to 0.111 from 0.323 (Linear Regression) when compared with the random split setup. The large standard deviation of the source split compared to the others demonstrates that the performance is impacted by the topic and style differences in posts by accounts in training data and unseen test data.</p><p>Overall, we note that the task of predicting persistence is challenging as we used reasonable NLP methods with a vast range of feature types in our  experiments for a best effort modelling approach. We note that the models can predict better than chance in all setups and show good generalization in out-of-time experiments, which prove generalizability and robustness in a real-world scenario. The raw Spearman correlation values are in a similar range as those for related tasks such as predicting popularity (retweets) using content alone e.g. 0.229 -0.358 ρ with textual, social and visual features <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wang et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">6</ref> shows the results (Spearman correlation) of the BERT model with various combinations of features. The best results on both the temporal and random splits are obtained with the combined textual features from tweet text body and account description. However, the best performance on the source split is obtained only using tweet text body. Adding account description features significantly dropped the performance, showing that the account features do not extrapolate well for predicting persistence of other accounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion and Future Work</head><p>The key assumption for the experimental setup used in the paper is that persistence of news can be predicted primarily through textual content, and other limited information information that is available at story publication time (follower count, account <ref type="bibr">description)</ref>. This enables applications such as news prioritization, which aims to identify a priori and more prominently feature stories that are likely to be breaking and attract a high interest immediately after their publication.</p><p>The experimental design around data used in the paper, including ranges and splits, also aims to mirror the approach that is used in a system designed for news prioritization. Experiments with the tem-poral split of the data emulates a setup in which the model can be retrained regularly using recent stories and their persistence-related observations. Predictions can then be made on new data from a recent day unseen in training, which can see a drift in topics or events. The temporal split assumes that the news sources remain constant across training and prediction within a given date range. The source split experiments aim to show the generalizability of the model, and establish its baseline performance on data from a new data source. Once this new data source is included for an extended period of time, retraining with that data would bring performance close to that of the temporal split experiments.</p><p>Other applications that can use a news persistence measure include search and recommendation, content promotion, and content resurfacing. For most of these applications, the prediction of persistence does not need to be made at story publication time and can benefit from measures of initial interest in the story. We consider this information to be complementary to that available through the story content. Combining our methods with those from the cascade prediction literature would be valuable future work for understanding persistence and further improving the predictive performance.</p><p>Additional structured information about the account or publisher, such as network information, can also be used to further improve predictive performance.</p><p>Separately, while we focused on written news stories, the concept of persistence can be relevant to other settings and types of content, such as images, and information or transcripts from videos or audio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>This paper presented a computational linguistic study of the concept of persistence. We operationalized this concept by measuring the time in which tweets from news accounts obtain 60% of their total interest, as defined through counting the number of retweets and showed this is different than news popularity or importance. We performed several analyses to uncover patterns in our data and trained machine learning models that are able to predict at tweet publication time its persistence score significantly above chance, even for accounts unseen in training, demonstrating the robustness and ability to generalize. We expect this task to be useful to downstream applications such as search, recommendations and identifying content to promote. Future work will study additional modelling approaches for this challenging task, use social factors like cascades and information about users engaging with the content to study and predict persistence and the impact of the persistence score in predicting cascades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Limitations</head><p>We only studied English-language news tweets published on a given week. Working with more data would only improve the prediction results. We acknowledge the feature analysis and magnitude of results may not hold to other languages, types of news or different time ranges, but our methods for analysis are easily applicable and transferable to any new domain, language or time range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Choice of Interest Metric</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the aggregated cumulative distributions of retweet counts and like counts over time as a fraction of the total number of retweets within the first 72 hours of publication. The Pearson correlation between the aggregated number of retweets and aggregated number of favorites at each hour after publication, up until 72 hours, across all tweets in our dataset, is 0.999, significant at p &lt; 0.001. Additionally, the Pearson correlation between the total number of retweets and total number of favorites within the first 72 hours after publication, is 0.814, significant at p &lt; 0.01. The figure, along with these correlations show that retweets and favorites are congruent proxies for reader interest.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows histograms of the number of hours it took for tweets in our dataset to reach T % of their total retweets within 72 hours of publication, at thresholds T ∈ {50,60,70,80}.</p></div>

Thus, we split the data based on the time at which it was published, with the training data from the first three days (3 December 2019 -5 December 2019) and the data held-out for testing authored on the next day (6 December 2019). Source We next split the data into training, development and test based on the source of the tweet. Thus, this setup reflects the scenario in which a model is trained on data from a set of sources and tested on tweets from unseen sources. We split the accounts randomly in a 60% train, 20% test, 20% development ratio, then assign all tweets from an account to either the train, development or test sets. Random Finally, we also create a random split, where data is randomly split in training, development and testing using a 70% train, 10% development, 20% test proportion.
