<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Politeness is a key component that can assist in building a strong customer-agent relationship. With the ongoing increase in customer-care systems, it is crucial to have healthy relations with the users providing satisfaction and a better customer experience. In this regard, it is significant to model the different polite behaviors in an agent to help the user in reaching the intended objectives. In our current work, we propose the task of polite behavior-aware generation considering the affective state of the user and the conversational context. We design a Transformer based encoder-decoder framework with three major components i.e., Affective tracker, Behaviour-aware generators, and Polite generator. The affective tracker is a context encoder that captures the contextual information along with the affective information in the utterances; the behavior-aware generators independently attends to the context information to compute behavior-aware polite representations and finally, polite generator generates the final polite response considering the representations from different generators. Experimental results on the CYCCD dataset prove that our approach generates contextually correct and relevant responses compared to the state-of-the-art approaches and the baselines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the proliferation of conversational systems (chatbots and personal assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home, and Apple's Siri) in our daily lives. These conversational systems that aim to assist users in numerous ways like making reservations, booking flights, scheduling appointments and many more are prevalent in several areas such as hospitality, education, and health care, to name a few. The success of these systems * The authors are jointly first authors.</p><p>significantly depends on their ability to effectively communicate with the users. Thus, the research in recent times has been inclined towards modulating biases, styles, and control in text generation to improve these interactions.</p><p>Customer care is a typical application area for automated task-oriented conversational systems. These systems provide potentially cost-effective and reliable solutions for customer care. Nowadays, companies rely heavily on customer care service to successfully guide and assist customers and establish long-term and healthy relationships with them. Customers generally interact with conversational agents with diverse expectations and attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Følstad and Skjuve, 2019)</ref>. In such situation, if the agent fails to satisfy their expectations or fix their issue as desired, they may get frustrated or furious quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Jain et al., 2018)</ref>. To avoid this, it is imperative for customer care agents to mimic human-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fink, 2012)</ref> behaviour during the conversation.</p><p>Politeness and empathy, which encompass social belongingness are a few fundamental sociolinguistic cues of humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Maslow, 1943)</ref>. The use of social language by the agents facilitates building rapport and emotional connection with the customers. Politeness has been investigated recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Golchha et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Firdaus et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Priya et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2023a</ref><ref type="bibr">Mishra et al., , 2022a;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Firdaus et al., 2022b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2022b</ref><ref type="bibr">Mishra et al., , 2023c,b;,b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Priya et al., 2023b)</ref> to ensure user satisfaction and to build strong user relations. Politeness could have different behavioral aspects linguistically such as one could be apologetic, appreciative, empathetic, or could be respectful by always greeting and assuring. Such behavioral patterns could lead to different responses that are contextually plausible and interactive.</p><p>Emotion and sentiment of the user are essential for meeting the user's wants appropriately and facilitating the creation of smooth and amicable conver- sations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beale and Creed, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Shi and Yu, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Firdaus et al., 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr">Firdaus et al., , 2022c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Firdaus et al., , 2023;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Singh et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Samad et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Madasu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Firdaus et al., 2022c,d)</ref>. The usage of user feedback in the form of emotion and sentiment is essential for generating contextually coherent polite responses reflecting relevant polite behaviour in the responses as depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For the first example in Table 1, it can be seen that the user's emotion and sentiment are negative. The appropriate response in such a scenario could either exhibit empathy or apologize or provide assurance. For this particular example, the polite behaviour is assurance which could help in smoother conversations with the user.</p><p>In our current work, we take a step ahead and address the task of behaviour-aware polite response generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the very first attempts that addresses the linguistically driven different behavioural patterns of the polite generation. We build an end-to-end transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for the task of behaviour-aware polite response generation. Our proposed architecture captures the complete affective information in the form of emotion and sentiment from the conversational context and uses this knowledge for generating behaviouraware polite customer care responses.</p><p>In summary, the key contributions of our work are three-fold. We first introduce the task of behaviour-guided polite response generation for customer-care systems. Second, we design a transformer-based encoder-decoder network having three crucial components, i.e., an affective tracker, behaviour-aware generators, and a final polite generator to capture the emotional quotient from the context and generate behaviourwise response representations and finally generate the polite response using the weighted-sum approach. Lastly, experimental analysis on the CY-CCD dataset shows that our approach performs better than all the existing baselines and generates more informative and varying responses.</p></div>

The inclusion of user feedback in the form of emotion and sentiment provides complete affective information, which in turn, enhances the quality of generation and makes the responses contextually coherent with the dialog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we present the problem definition of our current task and provide a detailed description of our proposed approach. Our approach focuses on generating responses based on the speaker's emotional state from the conversational context constrained by the different polite behaviour such as Appreciation, Empathy, Apology, Greeting, and Assurance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Definition</head><p>Our current work aims at generating contextually appropriate responses based on different polite behaviour. Precisely, the conversation has an alternating set of utterances from the customer (U i ) and the customer care agent (A i ). We represent the conversational context as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C = (U 1 , A 1 , U 2 , A 2 , • • • , U i</formula><p>) and each utterance is a sequence of words w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w N .</p><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Golchha et al., 2019)</ref>, we use the output distribution from DeepMoji <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Felbo et al., 2017)</ref> (pre-trained on the emoji prediction task) to get the emotional embeddings (E emo ) associated with both the customer and agent utterances. In addition, we also use the sentiment information (E sen ) along with the emotional embeddings to get complete affective information. This information is added with every utterance to assist in generating the final behaviour-aware polite response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Approach</head><p>In this section, we describe each component of our proposed model in detail. Overall, our model is composed of three components: a Affective tracker, Behaviour-aware generators and a final Polite generator as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The Affective tracker is basically the context encoder that provides the representation of the context and computes a distribution over the possible sentiment and emotion categories for the context. The Behaviour-aware generators independently attend to this distribution to compute their own representation. Finally, the Polite generator takes the weighted sum of representation from the different generators and generates the final polite response. We also incorporate speaker information as embedding in the input with every utterance. This is used to facilitate the encoder to differentiate between the customer and agent utterances.</p><p>Affective Tracker: The context encoder uses a standard transformer encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> for the sentiment and emotion (Affective) tracker. To capture the hierarchical nature of the conversation, we use a hierarchical transformer encoder to capture the utterance-level and dialoguelevel representations. We use the utterance transformer to get the encoded utterance representation. To learn the representation of each utterance U i ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U i = w i 1 , w i 2 , . . . , w i N is first mapped into continu- ous space T u = (t i 1 , t i 2 , . . . , t i |U i | ); where[t i j = e(w i j ) + p j ]</formula><p>(1) where, e(w i j ) and p j are the word and positional embedding of every word w i j in an utterance, respectively. For words, we use Glove embeddings and adopt the sine-cosine positional embedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> as it performs better and does not introduce additional trainable parameters.</p><p>The utterance encoder (a Transformer) converts T u into a list of hidden representations</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h i 1 , h i 2 , . . . , h i |U i | .</formula><p>We use the last hidden representation h i |U i | (i.e. the representation at the EOS token) as the textual representation of the utterance U i . Specifically, the final utterance representation E U is the sum of the final textual representation h i |U i | , the positional embedding E p <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>, the speaker embedding E s , the emotion embedding E emo and the sentiment embedding E sen of the corresponding utterance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E U (C) = h i |U i | +E p (C)+E s (C)+E emo +E sen</formula><p>(2) In a similar fashion, we encode the agent utterances as well.</p><p>The final utterance representation is used as input for the dialogue transformer that encodes the dialog context into a context representation. In order to compute the weighted sum of the output tensor, we add a query token QRY at the start of each input sequence, similar to BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Devlin et al., 2018)</ref>. If a transformer-context encoder is designated as T RS enc , then the relevant context </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">H C = T RS enc (E U ([QRY ; C)])) (3)</formula><p>where [;] denotes concatenation, H ∈ R L model where L is the dialogue length. Then, we determine the final representation of the token QRY as q = H 0 where q ∈ R d model , which is then used as the query for generating the sentiment and emotion distribution.</p><p>Behaviour-aware Generators: The behaviouraware generators mainly consist of (1) a shared behaviour generator that learns shared information for all the emotions and their corresponding polite behaviour and (2) n independently parameterized Transformer decoders <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> that learns how to appropriately react in a polite-manner given a particular affective state.</p><p>A standard transformer decoder layer block, abbreviated as T RS dec , models all of the generators and is composed of three sub-components: a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, multi-head attention over the output of the Affective tracker, and a multi-head self-attention over the response input embedding.</p><p>As a result, we specify the generator's set as G = [T RS 0 dec , ..., T RS n dec ]. Each generator constructs its own polite response representation P i using the target sequence altered by one r 0:t-1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P i = T RS i dec (H C , E R (r 0:t-1 ))<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where T RS i dec refers to the i th generator, including the shared one. From a conceptual standpoint, we anticipate that the shared generator, T RS 0 dec , will produce a general representation that will aid the model in capturing the discourse context. On the other hand, we anticipate that each behaviouraware generator will develop its ability to react in a designated polite behaviour based upon a certain emotion and sentiment. In order to simulate this phenomenon, we give each behaviour-aware generator a varied weight based on the user's emotional distribution, while giving the shared listener a set weight of 1.</p><p>To illustrate, we create a Key-Value Memory Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Miller et al., 2016)</ref> and represent each memory slot as a pair of vectors (k i , P i ), where k i ∈ R d model signifies the key vector and P i is from Equation 4. The key vectors k are then addressed using the encoder-informed query q by performing a dot product and then a Softmax function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v i = e q T k i n j=1 e q T k i (5)</formula><p>The weight of each listener is determined by using each v i as the score given to P i . Given the speaker's affective state e t , we oversee each weight v i throughout training by using a cross-entropy loss function to maximize the likelihood of the emotion state e t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L 1 = -logp et (6)</formula><p>Finally, the weighted sum of the shared generator output P 0 and the memory values P i is used to calculate the combined output representation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P M = P 0 + n i=1 v i P i (7)</formula><p>Polite Generator: The polite generator is then implemented using a second transformer decoder layer, which further transforms the behaviouraware generator's representation and produces the final response. On the basis of emotion and sentiment, each behaviour-aware generator is thought to specialize in a certain polite behaviour, and the polite generator compiles the ideas from different generators to create the final response.</p><p>Therefore, we define another T RS f inal dec , and an affine transformation W ∈ R d model ×|P | to compute:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P f in = T RS f inal dec (H, P M )<label>(8)</label></formula><p>S t = p(r 1:t |C, r 0:t-1 ) = sof tmax(P T f in W ) (9)</p><p>where P f in ∈ R d model ×t is the output of the polite generator and p(r 1:t |C, r 0:t-1 ) is the distribution over the vocabulary for the next tokens. The response prediction is then optimized using a standard maximum likelihood estimator (MLE):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L 2 = -logp(S t |C)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Finally, by minimizing the weighted-sum of two losses, all the parameters are jointly trained end-toend to optimize behaviour selection and response generation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L = αL 1 + βL 2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where α and β are trainable hyperparameters to balance the two loss functions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dataset and Experiments</head><p>In this section, we present the dataset used for our experiments followed by training details, baselines, and evaluation metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>For our current work, we use the CYCCD dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Golchha et al., 2019)</ref> 1 having interactions between customers and professional customer care agents of companies on their Twitter handles. The CY-CCD Twitter data was taken from the dataset made available on Kaggle by Thought vector. We use the generic and polite annotated version of the CY-CCD dataset in a similar manner as <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Golchha et al., 2019)</ref>. The dataset consists of 140k, 20k and 40k conversations in training, validation and test set respectively.</p><p>As the CYCCD dataset was not annotated for different polite behaviour, therefore we do the politebehaviour annotations for the dataset. To annotate the CYCCD dataset with behavioural information, we employ crowd-workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) that label every utterance with 1 https://github.com/Mauajama/Courteously-Yours the provided set of labels (i.e., assurance, empathy, apology, greeting, appreciation). For labelling the utterances, the workers were asked to follow the instructions and guidelines provided for annotation. Some of the significant guidelines for annotation were as follows: (i). Every utterance of a given dialogue was to be marked with the provided labels; (ii) In addition, the workers were asked to provide the overall behaviour label for every sentence in an utterance as well. For cases where we found different annotations in polite behaviour for a particular sentence, we remove them from the dataset, and we also drop the entire conversation to maintain coherence among the utterances. A majority voting scheme was used for selecting the final label for every sentence. We observe a multirater Kappa (McHugh, 2012) agreement ratio of approximately 75%, which can be considered as reliable. The polite-behaviour distribution of the CYCCD dataset is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training Details</head><p>We used 300-dimensional word embedding and 300 hidden sizes in each and every experiment. We use word embedding initialized with Glove <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> embedding pre-trained on Twitter and share it across the encoder and decoder. The rest of the parameters are randomly initialized. We employ two self-attention layers, each with two attention heads and a 40-element embedding dimension. We substitute a 1D convolution with 50 filters of width 3 for the Positionwise Feedforward sub-layer. We use batch sizes of 1 while testing while using batches of 16 during training.</p><p>In order to train our model, we used the AMS-Grad <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Reddi et al., 2019)</ref> as the optimizer to mitigate the slow convergence issues and changed the learning rate following <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> </p></div>

In addition, we also provide a few examples of our generated responses to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed model followed by a brief error analysis of our approach and the baselines.</p><p>Automatic Evaluation Results: To illustrate the efficacy of our model we provide the automatic evaluation results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The table shows the results of different existing approaches that generate polite responses followed by the results of our model and the ablation study for our approach. The perplexity of our approach is the lowest compared to the existing approaches, i.e., 0.987 indicating the responses are fluent and grammatically correct.</p><p>The BLEU-4 and Rouge-L metrics provide information regarding content preservation to avoid loss of information or inconsistent generation. From the table, we see that the Seq2Seq model has the lowest scores for both the metrics followed by the HRED approach. This indicates the inability of LSTM-based models to capture long-term information for a consistent and informative generation. In addition, the reinforced approach Polite-RL shows slight improvement compared to the basic models. The PG-RL framework gives better scores for both BLEU-4 and Rouge-L using pointer generator network that directly copies the words from the context. Our approach performs better for both the metrics with the ability of transformers to capture better representations from the dialogue context.</p><p>We also provide the politeness accuracy of the generated responses in the table. Our approach has an improvement of 4% and 8% compared to the HT+RL+SE and PG-RL frameworks, respectively. Even though the HT+RL+SE approach uses sentiment information for polite response generation, we outperform their approach with the help of affective tracker that captures the overall emotional content from the context for the consistent and relevant polite generation.</p><p>We also provide the ablation study of our approach in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The HT approach without the affective tracker and the behaviour-aware generators gives the lowest scores for all the metrics. By adding the affective tracker there is a gain in performance proving the significance of capturing the overall emotional quotient from the context. We also show the performance without the affective tracker, having only the behaviour-aware generators and the final polite generator. The performance is slightly better but still lower than the proposed approach indicating the importance of all the components in the proposed method.</p><p>Manual Evaluation Results: In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, we provide the results of human evaluation on the CY-CCD dataset. From the table, we see that the fluency scores of our proposed method is the highest compared to all the existing and the ablated models. The responses are fluent and grammatically correct making the responses complete.</p><p>In the case of the relevance metric, we gain an improvement of around 0.4% compared to the HT+RL+SE framework that uses sentiment information as feedback to generate consistent and relevant polite responses. We perform better as we employ the entire emotional content present in the context using the affective tracker for generating behaviour-aware polite responses that are in accordance with the context.</p><p>Finally, the politeness appropriateness scores are highest with an increase of 5% and 13% from the HT+RL+SE and PG-RL frameworks. This could be contributed to the behaviour-aware generators that assist in generating correct polite responses in accordance with the ongoing dialogue. This also ensures that the different polite behaviours are important to generate the correct and appropriate responses. The performance of the proposed approach is significantly better than all the existing approaches and the ablated models.</p><p>Case Study and Discussion: In  Also, the responses are consistent and relevant. For the first example, "Hey, I got food poisoning from your inflight..." could be responded to in one of the three ways such as the agent could be apologetic about the situation, empathize with the customer or assure the user for a better outcome. In either of the above-mentioned behaviours, politeness is a key component and is well represented in the generated response showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed method. For the last example, "I need the software update urgently, the battery lasts.. ", the agent shows variations in polite behaviour and helps the user with the said problem either by just greeting, apologizing, or assuring the user. From the generated responses, it is clear that polite behaviour is significant for generating relevant, interactive, and better responses.</p><p>In addition, from the last example in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, we see that the generator is capable of generating responses capturing the information in the context. This concludes the fact that the proposed approach is not only capable of variating politeness in responses but also inculcates informative knowledge from the context. We also perform an error analysis for the proposed approach to properly evaluate the performance of our approach in comparison to the baselines. Some of the errors encountered by the models are: Loss of information: For a few responses, we see that the generated polite response lacks some of the information presents in the context making the response inconsistent with the ongoing dialogue. For example, the ground-truth response is "The order from KFC has been taken and will be delivered soon" while the generated response is "We will look into this and call the service center." Polite-behaviour inconsistency: In some cases, we see that the responses fail to capture the correct polite behaviour and generate responses that are inconsistent with the context. For the context "The fries were soggy and the burger was stale" the generated response is "Thank you for ordering, enjoy your meal." The generated response is incorrect as the agent should either be apologizing for the order or assuring the customer that the feedback will be taken care of in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In our current work, we focus on the variations in politeness based on the different behavioural pattern linguistically present in polite phrases such as greeting, apology, appreciation, assurance and empathy. We design a transformer-based encoderdecoder network with three major components an affective tracker, behaviour-aware generators, and a polite generator to incorporate politeness in responses according to the context. Experimental analysis of the CYCCD dataset shows that the proposed approach effectively infuses the behaviourwise polite phrases in the responses.</p><p>In the future, we intend to use unsupervised techniques to incorporate politeness in responses to create robust end-to-end systems. Also, the usage of politeness is important for goal-oriented conversations, therefore we plan to apply politeness to different domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our paper focuses on incorporating behaviouraware politeness in responses according to the dialogue context for polite response generation. The primary limitation is the availability of labeled data for modeling the variations in politeness for the different user-related queries. Nevertheless, we employed crowd workers for the data annotation which even though is a time-consuming and costly process yet is the most reliable way of getting the data annotated. Due to the unavailability of the polite behaviour-annotated dataset, we conducted experiments using CYCCD dataset only. In future, we will attempt to extend the experiments to more task-oriented datasets. Also, because of limited computational resources in academia, we weren't able to conduct experiments using LLMs such as GPT2, GPT3, PaLM, LLaMa, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Architectural diagram of our proposed behaviour-aware polite generator</figDesc><graphic coords="4,127.56,70.87,340.15,176.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
