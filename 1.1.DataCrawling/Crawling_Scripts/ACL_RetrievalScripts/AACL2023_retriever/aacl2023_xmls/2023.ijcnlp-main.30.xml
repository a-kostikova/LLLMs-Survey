<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of classifying a word in context according to its sense. For example, given the context "the field was covered in green grass," a WSD system would need to classify field as having its "flat open land" sense, rather than its "area of study" sense. Throughout its history, WSD has been associated with translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Weaver, 1949)</ref>, as it is understood that different senses of a word may translate differently. For instance, in the above example, field could be translated into French as champ, but not as domaine (the latter could, however, translate the "area of study" sense of field). In this paper, we address the open question: to what extent can a translation-based method improve modern WSD?</p><p>This question is surely an important one: WSD remains an active area of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blevins and Zettlemoyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barba et al., 2021a,b)</ref>, but despite the rapid improvements brought on by transformer-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> language models such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref>, substantial room for improvement remains <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Maru et al., 2022)</ref>. WSD has been used as a benchmark to compare and analyze transformer-based language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Loureiro et al., 2021)</ref>. It has also been shown to have applications to tasks such as translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Liu et al., 2018)</ref>, semantic parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Martínez Lorenzo et al., 2022)</ref>, and metaphor detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Maudslay and Teufel, 2022)</ref>. New variants of the task are still being proposed, such as visual WSD, in which candidate senses are represented by images <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Raganato et al., 2023)</ref>. Clearly, the ability to map a word in context to an entry in a discrete lexical knowledge base remains relevant in natural language processing, for both human end users and downstream tasks.</p><p>Incorporation of translation information has been shown to be useful for both classic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dagan et al., 1991)</ref> and modern <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Luan et al., 2020)</ref> WSD methods. Despite such proof-of-concept works, current state-of-the-art WSD methods do not explicitly leverage translation, leaving a potential source of knowledge untapped. It is therefore of interest to the lexical semantics community to investigate the extent to which senses and translations correspond, and how this correspondence can be leveraged in practice.</p><p>Our investigation has the following structure: (1) We begin by clearly defining the theoretically "ideal" mapping between senses and translations.</p><p>(2) We show that such mappings are rare in practice, even between unrelated languages, offering an explanation as to why translation-based WSD methods became less common as the field developed.</p><p>(3) We posit that it is possible to improve supervised WSD performance by leveraging instances where the translation of a word does determine its sense. (4) We propose and evaluate a translationbased disambiguation method to test this hypothesis. (5) We discuss the relationship between various theoretical properties and synonymy and polysemy.</p><p>Our empirical results strongly support our hypothesis. A large-scale intrinsic evaluation of our method using existing lexical knowledge bases shows that it achieves very high precision. Our extrinsic evaluation shows that synthetic training data produced by our method, when used to train a supervised model, can yield improvements in F1score of up to 4.6% on difficult WSD benchmark datasets. We conclude that the explicit incorporation of contextual translations has great potential to improve WSD research, and lexical semantics research in general.</p><p>The principal goal of our paper is the examination of the sense-translation connection from both theoretical and empirical perspectives in a modern context. Thus our contributions are twofold: a theoretical analysis of the relationship between senses and translation, supported by empirical analysis; and a method for efficient, unsupervised, largescale semantic annotation via translations, which yields substantial WSD improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The use of translations as a source of information about word senses rose to prominence in the 1990s, supported by the increasing availability of machine-readable multilingual resources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. (1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dagan et al. (1991)</ref> developed statistical approaches to WSD, with the former presenting a direct application to statistical machine translation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gale et al. (1992)</ref> were the first to explicitly define WSD in terms of identifying the correct translation: they identify a set of six English words, each with two senses, with a one-to-one mapping between those senses and their French translations. This paradigm of translation-informed WSD influenced the landmark WSD works of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yarowsky (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schütze (1998)</ref>, among others. By the late 1990s, translation was so prevalent in the WSD literature that <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Resnik and Yarowsky (1997)</ref> explicitly proposed "to restrict a word sense inventory to those distinctions that are typically lexicalized cross-linguistically."</p><p>Interest in translation in the WSD literature continued throughout the 2000s <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ide, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Apidianaki, 2008)</ref>, culminating in two SemEval-2010 shared tasks: cross-lingual lexical substitution <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mihalcea et al., 2010)</ref>, and crosslingual WSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lefever and Hoste, 2010)</ref>. The former can be viewed as the task of finding translations for a word in a given context. In the latter, translations from word-aligned parallel corpora were used to create a "multilingual sense inven-tory". The dataset was limited to small lexical samples, and involved substantial manual-annotation effort for each tested language pair. Neither the exact annotation criteria nor the datasets themselves are available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yao et al. (2012)</ref> observed that prior work made conflicting assumptions about the correspondence between senses and translations. They consider the case where a single word e in a parallel corpus is aligned, in different contexts, with two different words, f 1 and f 2 , in another language. They point out that some prior works, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lefever et al. (2011)</ref>, assume that e is polysemous, with f 1 and f 2 translating distinct senses of e, while others, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005)</ref>, instead assume that f 1 and f 2 translate a single sense of e, and so are synonymous. Our work builds upon this observation, analyzing the various possible relations between senses and translations in greater detail, and leveraging them them to improve WSD.</p><p>Despite the early successes of translation-based WSD, methods based on monolingual resources, namely WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Miller et al., 1990)</ref> and Sem-Cor <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Miller et al., 1993)</ref>, became prominent in the 2010s. It Makes Sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zhong and Ng, 2010)</ref>, a supervised WSD system based entirely on monolingual contextual features, remained state-of-the-art for most of the decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Papandrea et al., 2017)</ref> before being replaced by methods based on contextual embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hadiwinoto et al., 2019)</ref>. In the early 2020s, WSD systems leveraging increasingly sophisticated pre-trained language models approached and finally exceeded 80% accuracy on standard WSD datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Blevins and Zettlemoyer, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barba et al., 2021a,b)</ref>. In response to these advances, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Maru et al. (2022)</ref> proposed to focus on more difficult WSD instances, such as those involving rare senses, or on which modern WSD systems tend to make errors. We support this proposal, and make use of their "challenge" datasets in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Mapping Senses and Translations</head><p>While the use of translation information to identify or even define word senses was frequent in early WSD research, today it primarily serves as supplementary data, rather than as the core of the method <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Luan et al., 2020)</ref>. In this section, we lay the theoretical groundwork for explaining this paradigm shift; an empirical analysis follows in the next section.</p><p>Given an ideal one-to-one mapping between senses of a word and its lexical translations, each sense could be unambiguously defined by a distinct translation, and each translation would indicate a different sense. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a graphical representation of a sense-translation mapping which does not conform to this ideal, with three Italian translations of the English noun wood. An edge between a sense and a translation indicates that the former can be translated by the latter. As the sensetranslation mapping is not bijective, we cannot use translation knowledge alone to determine the sense of an instance of wood.</p><p>We can analyze the theoretical properties of such a mapping in terms of three word-level binary predicates, which are defined on a given source word e and language of translation F . Each of these predicates is a necessary condition for such an ideal mapping to exist. Moreover, in conjunction, they represent a sufficient condition for using a word's translations as a sense inventory. The three sensetranslation mapping predicates are discussed in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">One Sense per Translation (OSPT)</head><p>One Sense per Translation (OSPT) is the key predicate for translation-based WSD, as it facilitates the inference of a word's sense from its translation. OSPT underlies the method that we propose in Section 5.</p><p>OSPT(e, F ) := "all senses of the word e have disjoint sets of lexical translations in language F " If OSPT holds, each translation of e corresponds to exactly one sense, and so we can use the sensetranslation mapping to perform WSD. Exceptions to OSPT occur when words from different languages share multiple senses, a phenomenon which we refer to as parallel polysemy. For OSPT to hold, the source word cannot exhibit parallel polysemy with any of its translations. For example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a violation of OSPT, as the Italian word legno maps to two distinct senses of the English word wood. Therefore, the sense of wood in a given sentence cannot be inferred solely from the fact that it is translated as legno. On the other hand, if an instance of wood is translated into Italian as selva, we can infer that it is used in its "forest" sense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">One Translation per Sense (OTPS)</head><p>The One Translation per Sense (OTPS) predicate can be viewed as a dual of OSPT, reversing the roles of senses and translations. OTPS(e, F ) := "each sense of the word e has at most one lexical translation in language F " In other words, no pair of translations translate the same sense. Exceptions to OTPS are instances of synonymy between translations of a given source word.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> For example, the "forest" sense in Figure 1 maps to two distinct translations, bosco and selva, violating OTPS. This presents a challenge to the proposal to use translations as sense inventories <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997)</ref> by creating cases where instances of a word need not be distinguished by their translations. Moreover, this also poses a problem for aligning sense distinctions with translation distinctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lefever and Hoste, 2010)</ref>, as bosco and selva must somehow be "clustered" to avoid identifying instances of wood with these translations as being semantically distinct. Note, however, that unlike violations of OSPT, translations that cause OTPS violations can still be used to disambiguate the translated word in some cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">No Lexical Gaps (NoLG)</head><p>The No Lexical Gaps (NoLG) predicate reflects the importance of lexical gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bentivogli and Pianta, 2000)</ref> in multilingual semantics.</p><p>NoLG(e, F ) := "each sense of the word e has at least one translation in language F " Since it is not practical to enumerate all possible phrasal translations of each sense, such lexical gaps generally preclude translation-based WSD: we cannot identify a sense based on its lexical translation if it doesn't have a lexical translation. For example, the "golf" sense of wood in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> corresponds to a lexical gap, and so would need to be translated into Italian by a compositional phrase, such as "legno da golf". In summary, an ideal one-to-one sensetranslation mapping seems to be a very brittle structure. Any exception to OSPT, OTPS, or NoLG would complicate the use of translations to define sense inventories. Moreover, any exception to OSPT or NoLG will outright preclude the use of translations alone for WSD. The viability of translation-informed WSD therefore rests on the extent to which these properties hold in practice, which we investigate in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Empirical Analysis</head><p>We focus on English, with three languages of translation which represent various degrees of relatedness to English: Italian, Polish, and Chinese, For each language, we compute the proportion of English words for which OSPT, OTPS, and NoLG hold in BabelNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012)</ref>, a large lexical knowledge base frequently used as a sense inventory for multilingual WSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pasini et al., 2021)</ref>. We consider only English words with at least two senses in WordNet 3.0 (BabelNet inherits senses from WordNet), and at least one translation in the target language in BabelNet 4.0. There are 20,426 such words with Italian as the target language, 17,404 for Polish, and 19,973 for Chinese.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the results. The NoLG values indicate that the majority of English words involve at least one lexical gap in any of the three languages of translation. The OTPS row shows that even fewer words have no more than one translation per sense. The OSPT property is more reliable, covering almost 60% words with Italian as the language of translation, and approaching 80% with less related languages such as Polish or Chinese. However, the last row in the table demonstrates that only a very small percentage of English words satisfy all three properties at the same time.</p><p>Since we have argued that the conjunction of the three properties is a necessary condition for an ideal one-to-one sense-translation mapping, these empirical results provide an explanation why using translations as sense inventories is infeasible in practice. Furthermore, even if we had a sense inventory with a complete mapping between senses and translations (something BabelNet and comparable resources aspire to provide), the OSPT values in our results table indicate that a substantial portion of words cannot be disambiguated on the basis of their translations alone. We conclude that this was a key factor in the abandonment of the use of translations to induce sense inventories, or perform WSD on all words. Nevertheless, we posit that translations can be leveraged to improve WSD, specifically be exploiting those cases where a translation of a word in context uniquely determines its sense. In the next section, we present and apply a method for using translations to tag a subset of the tokens in a parallel corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Corpus Tagging with OSPT</head><p>Although the results in Section 4 demonstrate that translations alone are not sufficient for all-words WSD, prior work such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gale et al. (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lefever and Hoste (2010)</ref> have shown that they can still be applicable to lexical samples. In this section, we explore the idea of using translations to improve WSD on modern standard datasets. Specifically, we leverage those cases where the translation of a word corresponds to exactly one of its senses in order to create supplementary training data for a supervised WSD system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Corpus Tagging</head><p>The generation of "silver datasets" for WSD is a way to address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pasini, 2021)</ref>, the difficulty of obtaining training data for supervised WSD. To this end, the goal of semantic corpus tagging is not to disambiguate all word tokens, or any particular subset of lemmas; rather, the goal is to partially sense-annotate a corpus to produce supplementary training data for a supervised WSD system.</p><p>Automatic sense tagging has been a popular area of research in lexical semantics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Taghipour and Ng (2015)</ref> used a mapping of Chinese translations to English senses to annotate the English side of an English-Chinese parallel corpus; however, this mapping is not available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pasini and Navigli (2017)</ref> sense-tag Wikipedia articles using a variant of the personalized page-rank algorithm (PPR), while Delli Bovi et al. ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) applies a similar approach to the EuroParl parallel corpus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barba et al. (2020)</ref> use a pre-trained language model to identify semantically-equivalent translations of manually sense-annotated tokens. Most recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hauer et al. (2021)</ref> propose a family of pipeline approaches employing WSD methods, machine translation, lexical resources, and various filtering techniques.</p><p>Our work differs from prior work on using translations for WSD in that (a) we show that our method can achieve good results with only one language of translation, (b) our method is independent of statistical information such as relative sense frequencies, and (c) our method does not explicitly require any contextual information. In contrast, the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Apidianaki and Gong (2015)</ref> backs off to the BabelNet first sense (BFS), a frequencybased baseline, if it is unable to narrow down the sense of the target word. This back-off strategy is particularly undesirable for tagging tokens that correspond to rare word senses. Moreover, their method is tested only with multiple languages of translation, and is applied directly to all-words WSD on a parallel corpus, rather than to generation of high-precision training data. The method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bonansinga and Bond (2016)</ref> similarly depends on sense frequency information, and is evaluated only intrinsically, with multiple languages of translation. The method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Luan et al. (2020)</ref> depends on an existing disambiguation of the text, in addition to translations. Thus, our method is unique in that it can produce supplementary WSD training data with minimal assumptions about the available resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Method</head><p>Our method is inspired by <ref type="bibr">Loureiro and Camacho-Collados (2020)</ref>. They sense annotate only tokens that correspond to monosemous words, i.e., those that have only one sense, which is a trivial task in itself. However, they also show that a WSD method which propagates information between senses of different words can benefit from these annotations. For example, the monosemous word airplane is a synonym of the word plane, which is polysemous. Therefore, an annotated instance of airplane can inform a model about the context in which the corresponding sense of plane may appear.</p><p>In our approach, instead of monosemous words, we sense tag tokens which can be disambiguated based on their translations. For example, the English noun vault has four senses, corresponding to a burial vault, a bank vault, an arched ceiling, or a jump over an obstacle. The Polish word wolta can translate only the "jump" sense. Therefore, if we find an instance of vault translated as wolta, we can annotate vault with its "jump" sense, as no other sense could have been so translated. The absence of parallel polysemy between vault and wolta is a sufficient condition for the correctness of this annotation, regardless of whether OSPT holds for all Polish translations of vault. Our method uses this approach to partially annotate a parallel corpus, creating new sense-annotated WSD training data. Our hypothesis is that adding our translationbased annotations to a standard training corpus will improve the results of a supervised WSD system.</p><p>We follow the theoretical framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hauer and Kondrak (2023)</ref>. The sense inventories, as well as the mapping between senses and translations, can be obtained from a multilingual wordnet, such as BabelNet. Multilingual wordnets consist of synonym sets, or synsets, each corresponding to a concept, and containing the words which can express that concept. The synsets that contain a word correspond to its senses; a sense can be viewed as a pair of a word and a synset that contains it. The target-language words in that synset are the words which can translate that sense. For example, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, a multilingual wordnet should have a synset corresponding to the concept of "wood (material)" which contains wood and legno, but not selva.</p><p>The pseudo-code of the algorithm is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. It takes as input a sentence-aligned paral-lel corpus C, involving the source language S (in our experiments, English) and the target language T , which has been tokenized, lemmatized, POStagged, and word-aligned. The algorithm generates sense tags for a subset of the tokens on the source side of C. The algorithm consults a wordnet that covers languages S and T . For each content word token e on the source side aligned with a single target-language token f , we determine the number of synsets which contain both e and f . Since each sense of a word uniquely corresponds to a synset containing that word, this is equivalent to determining how many senses of e can be translated by f . If the result is exactly one, we annotate e with its sense corresponding to the synset s that it shares with f . For example, if an instance of wood is aligned with selva, it is tagged with its "forest" sense, given that it is the only sense of wood which selva can translate.</p><p>Our method is unsupervised, efficient, scalable, and fully explainable. Its running time scales linearly with the size of the The resources upon which it depends are freely available for a wide variety of languages. These include the parallel corpora our method annotates, a multilingual wordnet, as well as tools for tokenization, POStagging, and alignment. It operates purely on the basis of contextual translation, without the need for additional tools such as knowledge-based WSD systems or contextual embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Intrinsic Evaluation</head><p>We test our translation-based corpus-tagging method on the manual sense annotations in Mul-tiSemCor (MSC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bentivogli and Pianta, 2005)</ref>, a word-aligned sense-annotated bitext, which was created by manually translating SemCor <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Miller et al., 1993)</ref>. It is tokenized, POS-tagged, and wordaligned with a knowledge-based aligner. There are 91,937 English word tokens in MSC annotated with exactly one WordNet 1.6 sense, and aligned with a single Italian word. We randomly select 10,000 of these tokens, and strip them of their sense annotations to form our test set.</p><p>As our multilingual wordnet, we use MultiWord-Net (MWN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pianta et al., 2002)</ref> version 1.5.0. MWN was created by expanding Princeton Word-Net 1.6 by adding Italian translations, as well as new synsets to cover English lexical gaps. To mitigate the sense omission errors in MWN, we enrich it with 81,937 sense-translation pairs from MSC, excluding those which are in our 10k-token test set.</p><p>The results of the application or our method to the 10,000 annotated tokens in the test set yield a coverage of 33.3% and a precision of 92.6%, with the majority of errors caused by missing translations in MWN. Thus, our unsupervised method achieves higher precision than contemporary supervised WSD systems on standard English WSD datasets <ref type="bibr">(Barba et al., 2021b)</ref>. While these results are not directly comparable due to the different test sets, we interpret this as strong evidence for the efficacy and utility of our method for generating high-quality WSD training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Extrinsic Evaluation</head><p>Having demonstrated that our method can accurately disambiguate a subset of the tokens in a corpus, in this section we test whether sense-annotated data produced in this way can be used to improve the performance of a supervised WSD system. This is achieved by appending the data that our translation-based method produces to SemCor, a standard training corpus for English WSD. Note that no manual sense annotations exist for the corpus that we annotate in these experiments; we are creating novel sense-annotated data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Our parallel corpus is the English-Italian part of the OpenSubtitles corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lison and Tiedemann, 2016)</ref>, which contains approximately 35M sentence pairs.

Since MultiWord-Net is based on WordNet 1.6, we map each sense annotation to its most probable WordNet 3.0 equivalent, using a publicly available probabilistic mapping. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>As our supervised WSD system, we adopt the latest version of LMMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Loureiro et al., 2022)</ref>, which exploits relations between senses derived from WordNet in order to share information across related senses. Table <ref type="table">2</ref>: Statistics on the sets of sense annotations generated using the three filtering procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">Filtering Annotations</head><p>Supervised WSD systems tend to exhibit a bias toward senses which are frequent in the training data <ref type="bibr">(Loureiro et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, even a set of perfectly correct sense annotations may degrade the model's performance if the sense frequency distribution in the newly produced data diverges from that of the test data, which is not known in advance. We therefore filter the generated annotations to avoid greatly altering the sense frequency distribution of SemCor.</p><p>Following the example of Loureiro and Camacho-Collados (2020), we limit the number of annotated instances of each individual sense to 10, selected at random. This not only helps to prevent highly unbalanced sense frequency distributions, but also reduces the training time on the generated corpora. We refer to this set of instances as F10. In order to focus on gaps in the coverage on SemCor, we also test two additional filtering strategies that are applied to the annotations in F10. The first filters for lemma coverage (FFLC), by removing all annotations for lemmas which appear in SemCor. The second filters for sense coverage (FFSC), by removing all annotations for senses which appear in SemCor. Therefore, the FFLC annotations are a subset of the FFSC annotations, which in turn are a subset of the F10 annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.3">Datasets</head><p>We obtain baseline results by training LMMS on SemCor, specifically the version provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Raganato et al. (2017)</ref>. To test our method, we train three additional LMMS models which augment SemCor annotations with F10, FFSC, and FFLC, respectively. The sizes of these generated supplementary datasets, and of SemCor itself, are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate our models on the standard WSD benchmark of <ref type="bibr">Raganato et al. (2017, "R17")</ref>. In addition to providing the baseline SemCor training corpus, R17 also contains five English WSD test sets created for five shared tasks: Senseval-2 (SE2,  Edmonds and Cotton, 2001), Senseval-3 (SE3, Snyder and Palmer, 2004), SemEval-2007 (S07, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pradhan et al., 2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">SemEval-2013</ref><ref type="bibr">(S13, Navigli et al., 2013)</ref>, and SemEval-2015 (S15, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Moro and Navigli, 2015)</ref>. Following prior work, we use the S07 dataset to develop our method. We also evaluate our models on the concatenation of all five datasets, referred to as ALL<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , using the provided evaluation program; since LMMS disambiguates all words, the metrics precision, recall, F1, and accuracy are all equal throughout these experiments. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Blevins and Zettlemoyer (2020)</ref>, we also evaluate our models on the following subsets of ALL: most frequent sense (MFS), less frequent sense (LFS), zero-shot senses (ZSS), and zero-shot lemmas (ZSL). MFS and LFS are disjoint, and their union is the complete dataset; ZSL is a subset of ZSS. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the size of each such subset.</p><p>Finally, we also test our models on five new benchmark datasets of <ref type="bibr">Maru et al. (2022, "M22")</ref>: challenge (42D), amended ALL (ALLa), amended S10 (S10a), hardEN(hEN), and softEN (sEN).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.4">Results</head><p>The results in Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref> show that adding supplementary training data created by our method generally increases WSD accuracy, especially on rare and unseen senses. On the recently proposed 42D and hardEN challenge sets, we observe accuracy improvements of 4.6% and 2.5% respectively, using the F10 filtering strategy. This same approach yields improvements on LFS, ZSS, and ZSL partitions of the R17 ALL set, demonstrating that our method makes models more robust against such instances. We interpret these results as evidence for the efficacy and utility of our translation-based corpus tagging method.</p><p>The results further suggest that filtering generated annotations has a substantial impact on the resulting model. The frequency with which a word can be tagged with a particular sense by leveraging lexical translation need not correlate with the frequency of that sense in practice. Therefore, when using such generated corpora, care should be taken to select an appropriate filtering strategy. For instance, in a corpus where unseen senses or words are expected (e.g., in an unusual genre or domain), the FFSC filtering strategy may be the best option, as shown by its accuracy yields on ZSS and ZSL instances.</p><p>We conclude that our method for translationbased sense tagging offers substantial benefits, especially on difficult instances <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blevins et al., 2021)</ref>. These improvements are obtained using a recent WSD method which is based on pre-trained transformer-based language models. This demonstrates that lexical translation can be a useful source of information even for modern WSD systems.</p><p>As a final note, we note that since the phenomenon of parallel polysemy is closely related to that of parallel homonymy, our approach is wellsuited to homonym-level disambiguation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hauer and Kondrak (2020)</ref> argue that homonym distinctions are the coarsest possible sense inventory, and that almost all homonyms have disjoint sets of translations. Therefore, unlike OSPT, One Homonym per Translation (OHPT) does hold in general. Our translation-based approach could therefore be applied with near-perfect accuracy to disambiguate words at the homonym level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Our theoretical analysis in Section 3 established that OSPT is a sufficient condition for the ability to determine the sense of a word given its translation in context. However, the subsequent empirical analysis in Section 4 showed that OSPT does not hold in general. Nevertheless, our experiments in Section 5 provide clear evidence that we can leverage translations to produce high-precision sense annotations on the subset of word instances for which OSPT holds. These results demonstrate the importance of investigating the relations between senses, synonymy, polysemy, and translation. In this section, we further explore these ideas, taking the assumptions examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yao et al. (2012)</ref> (c.f., Section 2) to their logical extremes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">One Concept per Word: No Polysemy</head><p>First, let us consider a hypothetical language in which polysemy does not exist; that is, every content word has exactly one sense. In such a language, there could be no semantic ambiguity, and so WSD would be trivial: any given word could only express a single concept, regardless of its context. OSPT would always hold in such a language, no matter the language of translation, since each translation of a word could only translate its single sense.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no natural language contains only monosemous words. For example, 77.8% of English words in BabelNet occur in only one synset, with many of those being rare or technical terms. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Loureiro and Camacho-Collados (2020)</ref> observe that nearly 80% of lemmas in WordNet have only one sense, which allows them to generate useful resources for WSD. Only some constructed languages, such as Lojban/Loglan, strive to enforce complete monosemy on the lexicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cowan, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>The untenable position that rejects any partitioning of word meanings into senses ("one sense per word") relates to various approaches to both theoretical and computational linguistics. In theoretical linguistics, the monosemist approach holds that different observed senses of a polysemous word result from a combination of its unique core meaning with the pragmatics of each specific context <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(François, 2008)</ref>. In computational linguistics, methods that rely on exclusive use of static word embeddings, such as those learned by word2vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref> make no allowance for discrete senses or sense embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">One Word per Concept: No Synonymy</head><p>Now, let us consider the opposite extreme: a hypothetical language without synonymy. If a wordnet were constructed for such a language, every synset would contain exactly one word. For any given concept, there would be at most one word that could be used to express it. One Translation per Sense (OTPS) would always hold if such a language was used as the language of translation.</p><p>Again, it is unlikely that the entire lexicon of any natural language could satisfy this requirement. A language could perhaps be constructed according to this principle: for example, in Esperanto, synonymy and homonymy are considered undesirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Puškar, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, there will be a subset of any language which does satisfy this property. Indeed, approximately 56% of WordNet 3.0 synsets contain only one word (e.g., proton).</p><p>A similar position in computational linguistics ("one sense per context") is diametrically opposite to the monosemist approach described above. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Martelli et al. (2021)</ref> propose "dropping the requirement of a fixed sense inventory" and instead using representations which assign each word token a unique contextualized embedding. Such a position can be interpreted as an assignment of a unique sense to every occurrence of a given word in a distinct context. In view of our theoretical investigation, such an approach is effectively incompatible with our definition of synonymy. Nevertheless, the existence of synonymy in any human language is widely accepted in linguistics. In computational linguistics tasks, such as machine translation, need to account for synonymy, given that the goal is to produce fully fluent, rather than just semantically correct texts and utterances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">One Word ≡ One Concept</head><p>If the two constraints described above are combined, it would result in a language that has neither polysemy nor synonymy. We refer to this hypothetical language as Interlingua. In Interlingua, every concept could be expressed by exactly one word, which could express only that concept; every synset would have a size of one, and every word would be in one synset. Assuming a sense-translation mapping is available, e.g. via a multilingual wordnet which includes Interlingua, lexical translation into Interlingua could be reduced to identifying the sense of the source word. The converse also holds: the sense of a word could always be identified, given its translation into Interlingua. Working in the other direction, given a perfect multilingual wordnet, finding a translation for an Interlingua word would only require selecting a word from the corresponding synset in the target language.</p><p>Perhaps the most direct application for Interlingua is language-independent semantic parsing. Martínez <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lorenzo et al. (2022)</ref> propose the Babel-Net Meaning Representation (BMR), a semantic parsing formalism which converts an input sentence into a language-independent representation. Each content word is mapped to the unique identifier of the BabelNet synset corresponding to the concept it refers to. This creates a formal metalanguage in which every concept is unambiguously expressed in exactly one way: by the corresponding BabelNet synset ID. Hence, the BMR satisfies one "word" per concept and one concept per "word", with BabelNet IDs taking the place of words. There is no synonymy, as each ID is by design unique in representing its particular concept, nor is there polysemy, as each ID is unambiguous in its reference to some lexicalized concept. Thus, what may appear as a completely hypothetical and abstract construct can in fact be viewed as a theoretical model of a modern semantic approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we formulate several propositions related to senses, translations, synonymy, and polysemy. We show empirically that the assumptions that would allow translations to serve as a sense inventory hold simultaneously only for a small fraction of words. Nevertheless, we also demonstrate that the link between word senses and translations is not merely of theoretical interest. In particular, we present a method for leveraging translations to perform high-precision unsupervised sense annotation. We observe substantial WSD improvements especially on senses or lemmas that are less frequent or not found at all in existing training data.</p><p>Considering the above applications to constructed languages, contextual embeddings, and semantic parsing, we intend to continue our theoretical investigations into open issues in multilingual lexical semantics, and guide empirical research toward more explainable models and results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The principal limitation of our sense-tagging method is its dependence on linguistic resources, particularly text corpora and multilingual wordnets. As is the case with any method which depends on such resources, the reliability of our method will vary depending on the language to which it is applied, and the quality of the resources available. Care should be taken when applying our method to languages and domains, where resources are limited in terms of availability, coverage, or correctness. Any biases in these resources, e.g. biases toward English, may be inherited by our method. Likewise, the quality of translation and word alignment methods for pairs of languages will have a substantial impact on the quality of the data our method produces. Thus, before applying our method, we recommend assessing the quality of semantic resource coverage and translation and alignment quality for the languages under consideration. Nevertheless, the state of resource coverage and quality within NLP is improving, and we expect the applicability of our method to improve concordantly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example mapping between senses and translations.
